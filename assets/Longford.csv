Sections of former jail perimeter wall to site (13001062).","This substantial and impressive early nineteenth-century former jail reception/governor’s house retains its early imposing form and character despite recent alterations to accommodate new use as a school.  It is well constructed and has fine cut stone detailing throughout, such as the unusual doorcases and the prominent eaves cornice.  The use of differently coloured/textured dimension stone creates an interesting visual effect.  This prison complex replaced an earlier jail in Longford Town, which was located to the southeast, adjacent to St. John's Church of Ireland church, and now no longer extant (demolished by 1914).  The new prison was one of a number built in Ireland following an increase in agrarian unrest during the early-nineteenth century.  It provides an interesting historical insight into new thinking into the design of prison buildings at the time: the governor's house forming the centerpiece of a prison complex with the prison wings arranged around a courtyard to the rear and the prison exercise yards between.  It was originally designed to hold 150 prisoners, and cost £14,000 to construct.  A number of high-profile hangings took place here.  The last hanging reported by the Longford Journal was that of Charles McCormack for the murder of Michael Beglan and it took place in July 1863.  Lewis, in his Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837), records that Longford Jail ‘was erected in 1825, on the radiating principle, containing 8 day-rooms and airing-yards, in one of which is a treadmill, with separate cells for the prisoners, who are instructed by the schoolmaster and matron; three looms are also kept in the gaol for the employment of such as can weave’.  This structure forms the centrepiece of an interesting group of related structures, along with the former gatehouse (13001036) and gateway (13008001) to the east and the former prison wall (13001062), and remains an important element of the architectural heritage of County Longford.

Located to the north of Longford Town centre.","This late nineteenth-century Masonic hall uses many eclectic features and devices to create its eye-catching appearance.  Such an approach was typical in the late-nineteenth century, when many devices of seventeenth and early eighteenth century English and Flemish architecture were employed as part of a more informal attitude to design.  The scale and form of this structure remains intact despite some alterations and the construction of a large modern extension to the rear.  It is reputedly constructed using locally produced brick. It was originally built as Lodge Number 76 of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Meath and is of social importance due to its connections with the Masonic Order.  It is one of a number of Masonic halls/lodges still extant in County Longford, including another noteworthy example at Granard.  This building is probably named after Col E. R. King Harman, M.P.; a former Provincial Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Meath from 1880 until his death in 1888.  The King-Harman family had their seat at Newcastle House (13402709), near Ballymahon, from c. 1850 until c. 1950.

Located to the north end of Longford Town centre.","A complex and elaborate Church of Ireland church, which retains its early character.  It is well-detailed throughout with some fine cut stone detailing, particularly to the classical doorcase and the delicate needle spire.  It exhibits a characteristic Church of Ireland design of a three-bay west elevation with tower.  This substantial structure has a subdued late eighteenth-century mid-Georgian classical character on account of the round-headed window openings and the classical doorcase.  It was described as a ‘new church’ in 1787 by the Rev. Beaufort who visited Longford Town at this time.  The further enlargement and renovations of the early-nineteenth century were to accommodate a larger congregation following the enlargement of the nearby barrack complex.  Lewis (1837) describes the church as a’ spacious edifice, with a tower and spire; it was repaired and enlarged in 1812, at a cost of £3221, being a loan from the late Board of First Fruits; and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have lately granted £249 for its further repair’.  These alterations were carried out to designs by M. McCleland, a Longford architect (IAA).  The interior has a neoclassical feeling and contains a number of impressive marble memorial monuments, the earliest of which dates to 1691 and commemorates The Rev. James Sterling.  This monument was probably moved from an earlier deconsecrated church, which was a common practice at the time.  An attractive carved oak pulpit to the interior was designed in 1902 by John William Gunnis (born c. 1862), an English architect who was County Surveyor of Longford from 1891 – 1914 (IAA).  The graveyard contains a number of finely carved gravestones, the earliest dating back to the early-eighteenth century, including a number with elaborate cast-iron and/or wrought-iron railings.  One of the graves commemorates Sergeant Joseph Ward (1832 - 1872), who received a Victoria Cross for his bravery during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 - 8.  This church building is constructed on the site of a medieval Dominican Priory (LF013-026---- ), which was established c. 1400 by the O'Farrells, and the present building may contain fabric from this earlier complex.  The impressive cast-iron railings and the gateway complete the setting and add interest to the streetscape to the north end of Longford Town centre.  The cast-iron gates, cast-iron railings and the limestone gate posts are of the same design as found at the associated church hall (13002022) to the west, built 1864. This suggests that these railings etc may have been added to the front of the church at this time.",1700,1815,Regional,church/chapel,213259,275747,613207,775765,53.73137025,-7.799852498,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13002006_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13002006,SURV018

This building was reputedly built in 1807, and dates to a period when many hotels and sizeable commercial premises were being constructed in the larger Irish towns.  Pigot (1824) records the presence of an hotel on the west side of the main street in Longford Town known as 'The Longford Hotel', and it is likely that this is the building referred to.  A late nineteenth-century photograph from the Lawrence Collection (1895) shows that it had a round-headed doorway with cut stone block-and-start surround at this time.  Its location at a major junction, and its long established function, make this a landmark building in the town.  It contributes positively to the streetscape in terms of its style and type.  It was formerly known as Sutcliffe's Hotel (Slater's Directory 1881).",1800,1820,Regional,hotel,213144,275457,613092,775475,53.72876755,-7.801598856,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13002197_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13002197,SURV018

Formerly also in use as the Longford Grand Jury headquarters.  Possibly containing earlier fabric from a private house to site.  Substantially altered c. 1830, and between 1859 and 1861 with the addition of the upper floor.  Pair of single-storey bridewell extensions added to either side of street entrance c. 1900, demolished in 2005.  Flat roofed extension to the rear, built c. 1830 and demolished in 2005-6.

Rendered walls with raised rusticated cut stone quoins to corners.  Cut stone string course at second floor level.  Round-headed window openings to ground floor, square-headed openings to the first floor and segmental-headed window openings to the second floor, all with cut sills and moulded stone architraves.  Keystone detail to ground floor window openings.  Square-headed doorway with timber panelled double doors.  Pedimented Doric entrance porch with freestanding Doric columns and triglyph frieze.  Flight of cut stone steps to front flanked by rendered having moulded stone coping over.  Venetian window to first floor, above doorcase, with moulded surrounds; paired around-headed windows openings over to first floor having shared sill and oculus opening over to gable.  Set slightly back from street to the west side of Main Street, Longford Town.","This impressive, well-detailed and imposing public building dominates the Main Street in Longford Town.  It dates to the late eighteenth-century but has a confusing chronology due to extensive mid nineteenth-century alterations and extensions.  Its form is unusual for a court house and this suggests that it was originally constructed as a substantial town house, possibly for the Earls of Longford, and later converted for use as a court house.  The presence of a vaulted room to the basement with stone and brick wine racks, which would be a highly unusual feature for a court house, also suggests that it was originally built as a substantial private house.  This impression is further reinforced by the presence of a fine pedimented Doric entrance porch, which may have been taken from another building and added to the front façade at a later date.  The present structure replaced an earlier court house in Longford Town, which was probably located at the barracks complex, the former market square, to the north.  Its late eighteenth-century construction date predates the extensive court house building programme carried out by the British administration in Ireland during the 1820s.  The present court house formerly had an Italianate style cupola, added as part of the mid nineteenth-century alterations, and a clockface to the gable.  The window openings were also altered during the mid-nineteenth century.  These mid-nineteenth century alteration works were probably carried out under James Bell (1794 - 1872), the county surveyor at the time.  The present building appears to incorporate the cellars and other fabric from an earlier building to site, possibly pre-1700 in date.  This building was also in use as the Longford Grand Jury headquarters throughout the nineteenth century (until 1898).  This court house, now restored (2007), is one of the principal buildings in Longford Town and is an important element of the architectural heritage of the area.",1790,1865,Regional,court house,213149,275436,613098,775454,53.72857829,-7.801521231,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13002198_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13002198,SURV018

Located to the southeast of Longford Town centre.","This imposing cathedral is considered to be one of the finest classical style cathedrals/churches in Ireland and represents one of the largest building projects undertaken by the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland during the nineteenth century.  The height and distinctive profile of the Italianate campanile tower makes it a dominant feature on the skyline of Longford Town.  The well-crafted, if rather austere, exterior conceals a fine Italian Renaissance style interior that is remarkable for its use of space, and for the richness and complexity of its decoration.  Also of note are the relatively unusual north-south orientation and the rear elevation (north), which incorporates clergy accommodation or offices and looks decidedly domestic.  The construction of this cathedral was originally commissioned by Bishop O’Higgins in 1840, a man noted for his extravagant taste and ambitious plans.  The foundation stone was reputedly moved from the original St. Mel’s Cathedral at Ardagh.  Work was suspended in 1846 after the onset of the Great Famine (1845 - c. 1849) and recommenced in 1853.  It was dedicated in 1856 and consecrated in 1893.  It is the work of three eminent architects of the nineteenth century: John B. Keane (d. 1859), who made the original plans; John Bourke (d. 1871), who designed the campanile tower and continued the works after Keane’s death; and George C. Ashlin (1837 - 1921) who designed or supervised the construction of the entrance portico.  The sculpture to the pediment, depicting St. Patrick consecrating St. Mel as the first bishop of the diocese, is in Portland stone and Knockcroghery limestone and is the work of George Smyth.  The chapels to the two transepts have stained glass windows by the Harry Clarke studios.

Its arcading and groin vaulting are classically inspired, and it differs from the usual Irish market house form in having only one storey.  Particularly significant is the innovative use of a local pudding stone/conglomerate (from Slieve Caltragh near Ardagh) to articulate the external arches.  This building possibly dates to the early-seventeenth century, perhaps to 1619 when Longford Town passed into the ownership of Francis, Lord Aungier, who was granted permission to hold additional markets and fairs in the town at this time.  However, it is more likely to date to the end of the seventeenth or the early-eighteenth century, which was a more stable period in Ireland compared to the mid-to-late seventeenth century.  This building was later sold by the Aungier family to the Barrack Commissioners in 1774 (7th of July) and it was used as stabling for 28 troop horses.  The majority of the single-storey lean-to additions appear to date to the nineteenth century. The single-storey range to the north elevation almost looks domestic and may have been in use as soldiers accommodation.

The plain front façade is enlivened by the advanced gable-fronted central bay, the fine doorcase and by the polychromatic treatment to the window openings.  It was reputedly built to designs by the noted architect John Bourke (d. 1871), who also designed St. Mel’s College (13003002) and worked on St. Mel’s cathedral (13002327) in Longford Town.  The foundation stone was laid by the Most Rev. Dr. Conroy, Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise, on the Feast of St. Joseph in 1872.  The Sisters of Mercy previously had a convent along Keon’s Terrace from 1861 until they moved to St. Joseph’s in c. 1874.  This building is of social importance to the local community as a school and is an historical reminder of the role of the Sisters of Mercy in Longford Town.

Located in extensive mature landscaped grounds/demesne to the northwest of Newtown-Forbes.  Lough Forbes and River Shannon form western boundary of Demesne.","This imposing country house is important not only for its imposing architectural style but also for the personalities associated with it.  It largely dates to the nineteenth century (c. 1830 and c. 1860), but it contains fabric dating from the seventeenth, and probably the eighteenth century, creating a complex and confusing chronology.  The style of this building is typical of a number of large castellated Gothic houses built and/or extended in Ireland during the first half of the nineteenth century, including the Knockdrin Castle, Tullynally Castle and Killua Castle, all in neighbouring County Westmeath.  Castle Forbes has been the home of a branch of the Forbes family (later Earls of Granard from 1684), originally from Scotland, since the early-seventeenth century.  The design of Castle Forbes is similar to that of its namesake in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, built in 1815 (by a branch of the Forbes family), in that it has a central breakfront containing the main entrance and a massive tower on circular plan attached to one end of the principal elevation.  Arthur Forbes (later baronet of Nova Scotia) was originally granted extensive lands in County Longford c. 1620 and built a residence (on L-shaped plan and possibly incorporating the fabric of an existing castle) soon after.  This house/castle was later heavily damaged by a siege during the rebellion of 1641. This house was described by Dowdall (1682) as a 'fair aid spacious house with lovely gardens of pleasure'.  Eighteenth century fabric survives to the interior of Castle Forbes, suggesting that it was altered during this century.  A devastating fire in 1825 destroyed much of the original seventeenth century house, and the 6th Earl of Granard's family was accommodated in the surviving wings, which were remodeled by John Hargrave (c. 1788 – 1833) of Cork in the late 1820s.  It would appear that the rebuilding of the main house/castle was undertaken by the 7th Earl, George Forbes and his Roman Catholic wife, Jane Colclough, c. 1860.  They chose the rising architect J. J. McCarthy (1817 – 1882) to execute the building in the Gothic Revival style, a style with which he was familiar due to his church commissions from the Roman Catholic Church.  A number of the window openings, particularly the paired lancets to the main body of the building and the paired cusped lancets with quatrefoil detailing to the tower, are distinctly ecclesiastical in character and were probably inspired by McCarthy’s numerous church commissions.  Further remodelling was undertaken following a fire in 1923 by F.W. Foster of London, under the directions of the then Countess, Beatrice Mills.  The execution of the interior and exterior features is testament to the skill of the craftsmen involved and to the architect's design.  Set within private grounds Castle Forbes forms the centrepiece of a complex group of buildings, which still serve a working demesne.  Castle Forbes has the largest demesne in County Longford and is one of the most important elements of the architectural heritage of the county.  The Forbes family is important in the history of Longford and indeed the wider history of Ireland.  In 1661, the Manor of Mullingar was granted to Sir Arthur Forbes, whose family would own/control the town for 200 years.  The 1st Earl of Granard (title created 1684), Sir Arthur Forbes (1623 – 1695), served as a lieutenant general in the British Army and was later Lord Justice of Ireland (in office 1671 and 1673).  The 3rd Earl of Granard, George Forbes (1685 - 1765), was an admiral in the Royal Navy.  The sixth Earl, George Forbes (1760 - 1837), was made Baron Granard in 1806, a title that gave the Earls an automatic seat in the House of Lords.  The 8th Earl, Bernard Arthur William Patrick Hastings Forbes, held junior office in the Liberal administrations of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith and was later a member of the Irish Senate from 1922 to 1934.",1660,1865,National,country house,209892,280174,609841,780191,53.77121922,-7.850713002,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13303001_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13303001,SURV018

Additional outbuilding to site having pitched asbestos roof and having roughcast rendered walls.  Set with rear adjacent to the road, having random rubble limestone walls with ashlar gate piers on square plan and having double leaf wrought-iron gates, carved limestone gate piers with cast-iron pedestrian gate to site.","Although now out of use, this simple but well-proportioned house, of mid-nineteenth century appearance, retains its early form and survives.  It survives in relatively food condition, which is testament to the quality of the materials used in its construction.  It retains much of its early fabric including timber sliding sash windows, a timber panelled door of mid-to-late nineteenth century appearance, and a natural slate roof.  There is some evidence to suggest that this building formerly had a doorcase of some description (area around the doorway reworked), later removed.  The form of this building suggests that it is a vernacular interpretation of the typical three-bay two-storey house with muted classical pretensions, examples of which are a feature of the rural Irish countryside but are now increasingly rare.  It is interesting that the main elevation of this house faces away from the road, a feature that is difficult to interpret.  The simple collection of outbuildings, which indicate that this was a prosperous land holding/farm, and the simple rubble stone walls, cut limestone gate piers and gate posts, and the wrought-iron gates add considerably to the setting and complete this appeal composition.  This building appears to have been the residence of a Edward Mulvihill, who leased the land from John Shuldham c. 1860 (Griffith’s Valuation).  The Mulvihill family were a prosperous family of farmers and merchants who ran a number of businesses (including grocery and spirit stores; auctioneering; and coal, iron and timber merchants) in nearby Ballymahon during the second half of the nineteenth century.",1840,1870,Regional,house,218045,256913,617992,756934,53.56200891,-7.728419522,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402706_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402706,SURV018
13402707,Newcastle Bridge,,,,,CLOONKEEN (RATHCLINE BY.),Longford,LF,LF,"Four-arch road bridge over River Inny, built c. 1775.  Arch to the southeast end of bridge constructed on a smaller scale and now over dry channel of river.  Random rubble limestone construction to spandrels, piers, abutments, arch barrels and parapet walls.  Some remaining sections of lime roughcast render.  Segmental-headed arches with roughly dressed and squared limestone voussoirs.  Rubble stone cutwaters to piers (on V-shaped plan) having roughly dressed limestone quoins.  Chamfered dressed limestone coping over a number of the cutwaters.  Rounded dressed ashlar limestone coping over parapet walls.  Rubble stone wing walls to southeast ends of parapets.  Vernacular gateway to the southeast end of parapet to the west, comprising a pair of roughly dressed limestone gate posts (on square-plan) having rounded heads and a wrought-iron gate.  Located on the northwest boundary of the present Newcastle House demesne (13402709), and to the east of Ballymahon.","This fine road bridge retains its early character and form.  The narrow-plan of this bridge suggests that it is quite early, perhaps dating to the mid-eighteenth century.  The relatively broad span of the arches are of some engineering merit, particularly for their date of construction.  The elegant form of this road bridge is enhanced by the textural variation of random rubble limestone construction with the roughly dressed limestone voussoirs to the arches and with the dressed limestone coping to the parapets.  The impressive and robust cutwaters to both elevations of this bridge may originally have served as pedestrian refuges, later modified.  The now disused arch to the southeast side of the bridge indicates that the River Inny was considerably wider (probably dredged c. 1860, and possibly at the same time nearby Abbeyshrule Bridge (13402347) was modified) at this point when it was originally constructed).  The location of this bridge within the historic confines of the important Newcastle (13402709) estate hints that the Harman family may have been involved/funded its construction.  The present bridge replaced an earlier wooden bridge at or close to this site, which was extant in 1682 (Nicholas Dowdall recorded ‘that Newcastle, the antient Estate of the Earl of Kildare, now the Estate and habitation of Robert Choppin Esqr where he hath lately built a fair house and a wooden bridge over the said River').  Choppin was also reputedly involved in the construction of the bridge at Abbeyshrule (Dowdall 1682).  There is a bridge indicated here on Moll’s map of 1714 (‘A New Map of Ireland’) but it is unlikely that this is the present structure.  A bridge is also depicted here on the later Taylor and Skinner road maps of 1777 – 1783.  There are references to a ‘proposed bridge over the River Inny at Newcastle’ dated 1794, which was to be built for Lawrence/Laurence Parsons-Harman (1749 - 1807, 1st Viscount Oxmantown, to designs by John Sutherland (Irish Architectural Archive).  Sutherland (1745 – 1826) was one of the most celebrated landscape architects in Ireland, and it is likely that these designs were for an ‘ornamental’ estate bridge rather than Newcastle Bridge itself (it may have been the bridge indicated over the River Inny to the north of Newcastle House on the 1913 map of the area, now demolished).  This fine and imposing bridge is one of the most important structures of its type in County Longford, and is an attractive feature in the rural landscape to the east of Ballymahon.",1750,1800,Regional,bridge,218217,256896,618164,756918,53.56185887,-7.725826972,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402707_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402707,SURV018

Located to the west/southwest of Newcastle House (13402709), and to the east of Ballymahon.","This substantial walled garden(s), and associated outbuildings and green/glass houses, retains its early form and character.  The imposing boundary walls are well-constructed in good quality masonry, while the majority of the inner faces have been lined with brick to retain the heat of the sun (a characteristic feature of walled gardens for obvious reasons).  The good quality cut limestone block-and-start doorway built into the boundary wall is indicative of high quality craftsmanship and illustrates the attention and detail afforded to even the most utilitarian of features on the larger country estates at the time of construction.  Although now disused, this complex provides an interesting social and historical insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a large country estate in Ireland during the eighteenth and nineteenth century.  The walled garden(s) in a large demesne were not only an important source of food and income for the main house, but also frequently provided pleasure gardens for the enjoyment of the residents and guests.  This walled garden was probably largely laid out or greatly extended by Lawrence/Laurence Parsons-Harman (1749 - 1807), who inherited the Newcastle estate in 1784.  The King-Harman family archives (held in Public Record Office in Northern Ireland) outline details of the laying out of walled gardens (c. 4 acres) and the planting of 150 fruit trees and vines on the Newcastle estate in 1787 - 9.  Lawrence Parsons-Harman (M.P. for Longford 1776 – 1792; Baron/Lord Oxmantown 1792 - 1795; Viscount Oxmantown 1795 - 1806; Earl of Rosse 1806 - 7; sat was one of the original 28 Irish Representative Peers in the British House of Lords from 1800 - 1807) greatly increased the Newcastle estate throughout his tenure, and by his death (1807) in its size had doubled to approximately 31,000 acres in size.  The interconnecting outbuildings and green/glass houses to the northwest end of the walled garden complex were possibly a later addition, perhaps added during the first decades of the nineteenth-century, and add considerably to the context, setting and understanding of this complex.  This walled garden and ancillary structures, forms part of an important collection of structures associated with Newcastle House (13402709), and is an integral element of the built heritage of Longford in its own right.",1760,1800,Regional,walled garden,218386,256906,618333,756928,53.56193772,-7.72327303,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402708_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402708,SURV018

Former stable block (13402710) to the east, complex of ancillary outbuildings (13402735) attached to the southwest side of main house, and walled garden complex (13402708) to the southwest.","This substantial and rambling country house was probably originally built during the early part of the eighteenth century but was later extended and altered on a number of occasions throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, creating a composition with a complicated and confusing chronology.  This building retains much of its important early historic character and fabric, despite some recent alterations to accommodate new uses, and is one of the more interesting and important country houses still surviving in County Longford.  It has a number of interesting features, such as the unusual Dutch style curvilinear gable to the centre of the main elevation, a feature that is mirrored in the treatment of the early nineteenth-century porch.  This curvilinear eaves gable is of a type that was relatively popular during the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries.  However, it is probably a later addition at Newcastle, perhaps added at the same time the porch was built, c. 1820.  The carved coat-of-arms to the porch appears to be of the King family(?), who inherited the building c. 1850 (becoming the King-Harman family). The stylistic influence of early-to-mid Georgian classicism is evident in the proportions of the façade of the main block, the odd number of bays allowing for a symmetrical layout, a central doorway and with the windows on the second storey diminishing in scale.  The form of this building hints that the second storey may be a later addition, perhaps added c. 1785 when the flanking wings were constructed (see below).  The second storey to the flanking wing to the southwest may also be a later addition (some evidence in the stonework).  It is possible that the front block of the double-pile structure was the original building, possibly dating the second half of the seventeenth-century, with the block to the rear added sometime later, creating the present double-pile form of the main block.  However, there is little evidence, either to the exterior or interior fabric, to confirm this.  The advanced flanking wings to either side of the main block were added during the late-eighteenth century, probably by Lawrence Parsons-Harman (1749 - 1807), who inherited the Newcastle estate in 1784, and greatly increased the extent of the estate to some 31,000 acres at the time of his death.  This ‘improving’ ethos suggest that he may have been responsible for much of the early alteration and extension to the house itself.  The vaguely Tudor Gothic addition to the northeast elevation, which has some high quality dressed ashlar and cut stone detailing, was added c. 1850. The form of this wing suggests that it may have been originally built as a chapel.  A number of interesting features survive to the interior including marble fireplaces, a number of early-Georgian timber panelled doors with lugged surrounds, and high quality neoclassical plasterwork that is probably the best example of its type in Longford.  This building forms the centrepiece of an important collection of related structures on the Newcastle House demesne, along with the stable block to the east (13402710), the outbuilding complex to the southwest (13402735), the walled garden to the southwest (13402708), gateway (13402723) and gate lodge (13402722) to the south/southeast, and the gateway (13402713) to the south/southwest.  The lands and house at Newcastle were successively in the possession of the Chappoyne/Chappayne/Choppin, the Sheppard, the Harman and the King-Harman families.  The earliest mention of the estate is references to an Anthony Chappoyne at Newcastle in 1660, although this may have been the site of an earlier ‘castle’ from as early as the fourteenth century (as the placename suggests).  In 1680 a Robert Choppayne appears to have purchased/consolidated the lands of Newcastle from Gerald Fitzgerald, 17th Earl of Kildare.  Dowdall (1682) describes the site as ‘..on the southside of the river is Newcastle, the antient Estate of the Earl of Kildare now the estate and habitation of Robert Choppin Esqr where he hath lately built a fair house and a wooden bridge over said river’.  The estate passed into the ownership of Anthony Sheppard (born 1668 - 1738), heir (son?) of Robert Chappoyne, c. 1693, who served as High Sheriff of County Longford in 1698.  His son, also Anthony, was M.P. for Longford in 1727.  The estate later passed by marriage into the ownership into the Harman family at the very end of the seventeenth century.  Robert Harman (1699 – 1765; M.P. for Longford c. 1760 -5) was in possession of the estate of much of the middle of the eighteenth century and it is likely that he was responsible for much of the early work on the house.  The Very Revd. Cutts Harman, who built the quirky hunting/fishing lodge at nearby Castlecor (13402608), inherited the house c. 1765 following the death of his brother Robert.  The estate later passed into the ownership of Lawrence Parsons-Harman (1749 - 1807) in 1784 (M.P. for Longford 1776 – 1792; Baron Oxmantown in 1792; Viscount Oxmantown in 1795; Earl of Rosse 1806; sat was one of the original Irish Representative Peers in the British House of Lords) and he greatly increased the Newcastle estate, and by his death (1807)  its size had doubled to approximately 31,000 acres in size.  It is likely that he was responsible for the construction of the side wings to the main block and general improvements to the house from 1784.  The estate passed into the ownership of his wife Jane, Countess of Rosse (who partially funded the construction of a number of Church of Ireland churches and funded a number of schools in County Longford during the first half of the nineteenth century), who left the estate to her grandson Laurence King-Harman (1816 - 1878) after falling out with her son.  Laurence King-Harman has probably responsible for the vaguely Tudor Gothic extension to the northeast elevation.  The brick chimneystacks also look of mid-nineteenth century date and may have been added around the same time this wing was constructed.  The King family had extensive estates in Ireland during the nineteenth century, owning the magnificent Rockingham House (demolished) and King House (31804023), Boyle, both in County Roscommon; as well as Mitchelstown Castle in County Cork, burnt in 1922 (memorial plaques and carved stone heads from Mitchelstown Castle were built into the northeast elevation of Newcastle House c. 1925, but have been removed and returned to Cork in recent years).  The estate reached its largest extent in 1888, some 38,616 acres in size, when Wentworth Henry King-Harman was in residence.  The estate was described in 1900 as ‘a master-piece of smooth and intricate organisation, with walled gardens and glasshouses, its diary, its laundry, its carpenters, masons and handymen of all estate crafts, the home farm, the gamekeepers and retrievers kennels, its saw-mill and paint shop and deer park for the provision of venison.  The place is self supporting to a much greater degree than most country houses in England’.  The estate went in to decline during the first decades of the twentieth century, and with dwindled in size to 800 acres by 1911.  The house and estate remained in the ownership of the King-Harman family until c. 1951, when Capt. Robert Douglas King-Harman sold the house to an order of African Missionary nuns (house and contents sold for £11,000).

Although out of use for a number a considerable period, these functional buildings retain much of their early character, form and fabric.  The gable-fronted breakfront to the outbuilding to the northwest, having a lunette window opening to the gable, lends this structure a subdued classical architectural character that contrasts attractively with the more prosaic single-storey structures.  The style of this two-storey building suggests that it may date to the middle of the eighteenth century.  The clustered diagonally-set chimneystacks are a later addition, perhaps added c. 1850.  The presence of chimneystacks to the two-storey building suggests that it may have had some additional domestic function, probably accommodating farm labourers, stable hands or, perhaps, an estate manager.  The infilled arches to a number of outbuildings indicates that they were altered on at least one occasion, and probably on a number of occasions.  This courtyard originally formed the southwest side of a pair of conjoined courtyards of outbuilding/stable blocks, the courtyard to the northeast was demolished sometime after c. 1913 (indicated on Ordnance Survey third edition six-inch map).

They were used to burn limestone to produce lime, which was used in construction/building as a mortar and a render, or to produce a fertilizer, which was then spread on agricultural land.  Lime was also used for lime-washing buildings, particularly farm buildings, as it was regarded as a cleansing agent at the time.

Gate post and gate to the north side of gateway now removed.  Coursed/snecked squared limestone rubble boundary walls to either side of gateway (north and south) having dressed limestone coping over.","This interesting and well-proportioned house, of late-nineteenth century appearance, retains much of its early form and character.  The loss of the original fittings to the openings fails to detract substantially from its visual appeal.  The full-height blind recessed arches to the front elevation are an interesting and unusual feature that help give this building a strong architectural character.  These arches are of a type that is sometimes found on small country houses dating from the end of the eighteenth and the start of the nineteenth century but they would appear to be later here at Rath.  However, it is possible that this was originally an early nineteenth century house that was substantially altered towards the end of the nineteenth century (the porch, canted bay window and the detailing of the chimneystacks are of late-nineteenth appearance).  The well-detailed entrance porch and the canted bay window to the east elevation add further interest.  The complex of outbuildings to the rear add substantially to the context and historic setting of the house.  These outbuildings are well-built using rubble stone, while the contrast between the grey rubble stone masonry/dimension stone and the red brick surrounds to the openings helps to create interesting textural and tonal appeal.  The two-storey outbuilding to the north of the house dates to the early-nineteenth century and was originally built to serve an earlier house to site (depicted on Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838; house on smaller footprint to site at this time).  This earlier house, known as ‘The Lodge’ was reputedly built as a single-storey hunting lodge by the Fetherston family of Ardagh House (13312039) who used this building as a base for hunting on Rath Bog (local information).  The townland of Rath was described in 1835 as ‘the property of John Fetherston Esq. (died 1839), held by deed forever’, while The Lodge as ‘a neat modern building… it has good orchards and offices attached’ (O’Donovan Letters).  The lands of Rath were leased by John Fetherston to Godfrey Shaw (1798 – 1847) in 1839 for a annual rent of £91, and this lease appears to have been renewed in 1862 (signed by John Bole, John Fetherston (son of above?), Mary Shaw and Robert Bole Shaw). Godfrey Shaw was born at Ardanragh Castle (13402405) near Legan.  Rath Lodge was the residence of an R. B. (Robert Bole?) Shaw in 1894 (Slater’s Directory).  A John Shaw (1838 – 1899), born at Rath Lodge, served as Governor of Lagos, West Africa, in 1874-5; Colonial Treasurer and Justice of the Peace for Sierra Leone between 1876 and 1880; and High Sheriff of Longford in 1880.  He died at Clooncallow House (13402714), a short distance to the southwest, in 1899.  This house, its outbuildings, walls and gateway form an attractive grouping in the landscape and contribute significantly to the architectural heritage of the local area.",1860,1900,Regional,house,220894,257222,620840,757244,53.56468499,-7.685411852,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402714_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402714,SURV018
13402715,Clooncallow House,,,,,CLOONCALLOW,Longford,LF,LF,"Complex of single- and two-storey outbuildings to the rear (north) of Clooncallow House (13402716) built c. 1800 and c. 1860, comprising a detached five-bay two-storey outbuilding to the south, c. 1800, and a detached six-bay single-storey former stable complex on L-shaped plan to the east, built c. 1800 and extended (to northwest) c. 1860.  Pitched natural slate roofs with cast-iron rainwater goods, rendered chimneystack to the centre of the two-storey range.  Roughcast lime rendered random rubble limestone walls to two-storey outbuilding with red brick eaves course and roughly dressed limestone quoins.  Evidence of blocked carriage arches to main (north elevation), infilled with brick.  Square-headed window openings to two-storey outbuilding having red brick voussoirs and chamfered limestone sills, and some having rendered sills.  Timber casement windows and some leaded glass windows to openings.  Square-headed door openings with red brick voussoirs and timber battened doors and timber battened half doors.  Shallow segmental-headed carriage arch to the east gable end having brick voussoirs and timber battened double doors.  Pitched natural slate roofs and cast-iron rainwater goods to single-storey outbuilding to the east.  Brick chimneystack to northwest section.  Coursed limestone rubble walls with flush dressed limestone quoins.  Square-headed openings with red brick block-and-start surrounds and having timber battened stable doors and half doors.  Entrance gateway to the southeast corner of yard comprising a pair of dressed ashlar limestone gate piers (on square-plan) having domed capping over.

Integral square-headed pedestrian entrance to the south end of boundary wall to the east.  Rubble stone walls to site.  Located to north of Clooncallow House, and to the east of Ballymahon.","This complex of outbuildings adds considerably to the setting and historic context of Clooncallow House (13402716).  They retain their early form, fabric and character.  The lack of detailing and the simple forms are indicative of their intended utilitarian functions.  The two-storey outbuilding to the south side of the yard probably dates to the early-nineteenth century, while the form and detailing to L-shaped single-storey outbuilding to the east suggests that it was built or heavily altered during the mid-nineteenth century, perhaps c. 1860.  There are a number of blocked carriage arches to the north elevation of the two-storey outbuilding indicating that this structure was altered at some stage, perhaps c. 1860 when the single-storey outbuilding was constructed or altered.  The contrast between the grey rubble stone masonry and the red brick detailing to the openings of the single-storey building creates an appealing tonal and textural contrast to the main facades.  The scale of this complex suggests that Cloncallow House was a prosperous farm at the time(s) of construction.  The remains of the walled garden to the northwest adds further to the setting and provides an interesting historical insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a middle-sized landholding in rural Ireland during the nineteenth century.  This complex forms part of a group of related structures along with the main house (13402716), the gateway (13402717) and the unusual tower-like structure (13402736) to the west of the house, and is an integral element of the built heritage of the Ballymahon area. There is a reference to a new 'Belgian' farm at Cloncallow/Clooncallow, near Ballymahon-Mullingar road, that was built/laid out in 1868 (subject of paper read by Hon. H.L. King Harman to Ballymahon Farmers' Club, published in Farmers' Gazette), however, this is probably in reference to a complex on the Newcastle House estate rather then this complex.",1780,1820,Regional,outbuilding,217614,256299,617562,756321,53.556513,-7.734952563,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402715_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402715,SURV018

It retains its early character and form despite recent alterations.  The small size of the window openings and the large expanses of blank wall to the front façade are indicative of a relatively early date. The well-detailed porch, which probably dates to the mid-nineteenth century, and the block quoins to the corners, help to alleviate the block-like appearance.  The window openings and surrounds to the ground and first floors are unusual for a house of this type/date and are probably the result of later alteration, possibly quite recent.  Set in extensive mature grounds, this fine structure is a worthy addition to the architectural heritage of County Longford.  The simple but well-built entrance gates, the rubble stone boundary wall, the landscaped grounds and the outbuilding add to the setting and complete this appealing composition.  This house was the home of the Cuffe family during the first half of the eighteenth century.  It was later inherited by Thomas Pakenham (later Baron Longford) following his marriage to Elizabeth Cuffe (1714-94) in 1739 or 1740.  It is possible that Viewmount House was constructed shortly after this date and it may have replaced an earlier Cuffe family house on or close to the present site.  The house was never lived in by the Packenham family but it was used by their agent to administer the Longford estate, c. 1860.  It was apparently in use as a charter school from 1753 until 1826, originally founded under the patronage of Thomas Packenham.

Architectural design and detailing have clearly been employed in its design and high quality craftsmanship is evident in features such as the timber tracery and stone dressings to the window and door openings, which are of artistic merit.  It was built under the patronage of the Forbes family of Castle Forbes (13303001) and the Achmuty-Munster family of Brianstown House (13401305).  The crow-stepped parapets to the gables are a particularly unusual feature, being vaguely Scottish Baronial in character, and may have been inspired by the Scottish heritage of the Forbes family.  They have a parallel at a stable range at Castle Forbes (13303003).  The interior of this church is noteworthy with a fine collection of decorative timber fittings and a collection of memorial monuments to the Forbes family.  The box pews with fielded panels are reputedly the only surviving box pews of the type in Ireland and are mid-eighteenth century in style, suggesting that they were moved from the earlier church or that they survived a later remodelling of the building.

Dressed limestone gate piers (on square-plan) with cut limestone capstones and cast-iron gates.","An attractive early nineteenth-century Church of Ireland church, built in a Gothic Revival style, which retains its early form, character and fabric.  Although now vacant, its salient features remain intact.  This church is of a more elaborate form than is more typically found in rural Longford, as is the standard of the cut limestone detailing, particularly to the openings and to the pinnacles of the tower.  The large window openings are particularly impressive, particularly the large Tudor-arched five-light window to the chancel gable.  The layout of this church is typical of the standard hall and tower church, which were built in large numbers, particularly between 1808 - 1830, using loans and grants from the Board of First Fruits (1722 - 1833).  These small, simple, but well-built churches have become almost iconographic features of the rural Irish countryside.  Lewis (1837) records that this church at Ballinalee was constructed using a gift of £1100 and a loan of £300 from the Board of First Fruits, and that it was enlarged in 1830 by aid of a loan of £300 from the same Board, and with a donation of £100 from the Countess Dowager of Rosse.  It was built to designs by the eminent architect John Hargrave (c. 1788 – 1833), an architect that worked extensively in County Longford during the 1820s.  It is not unlike a simpler and reduced version of Hargrave’s fine church at Portnashangan in County Westmeath (15401215) in that it shares the crenellated parapet, the wide pointed arch window openings to the nave, the five-light Tudor-arched window opening to the chancel and has a similar style of corner pinnacles to the tower.  Local sources suggest that the architect of this Church of Ireland church was William Farrell (died 1851).  Farrell designed the Church of Ireland church at Keenagh (13313025) in 1832, also under the patronage of Countess Dowager of Rosse.  Perhaps Farrell’s input here was the 1830 enlargement mentioned by Lewis (1837), which may have been an extension of the east transept.  The vestry at Ballinalee appears to have been added sometime later, perhaps c. 1860.

Round-headed carriage arch to the southeast elevation having wrought-iron gate and with a rendered hoodmoulding over with keystone detail.  Road-fronted on a sloping corner site to the centre of Granard.","The form of this Georgian market house owes much to its unusual site on a sloping corner site.  It retains its early form, character and fabric despite recent alterations.  It has an arcade to the ground floor (now infilled), which is a characteristic feature of market houses.  The presence of a large market house is testament to the economic prosperity and confidence enjoyed in Granard during the late-eighteenth/early-nineteenth century, when Granard was one of the more important market towns in the north midlands.  This building was described as ‘recently built’ by the Rev. Daniel Beaufort in 1787 and it is thought to have been built under the patronage of the McCartney family.  It was later in the ownership of the Greville family, c. 1840.  The first storey was in use as a court house throughout the nineteenth century (Lewis 1837; Slater 1846 and 1881).  Two-storey market houses with a court house to the first floor are a common feature of Irish towns and can be found in Ballymahon (13316010) amongst other examples.  It was in use as a school during the 1820s.  This market house was rebuilt c. 1925 after being damaged by fire during the War of Independence, a fate suffered by much of Granard at the time. The heavy hoodmouldings over the openings were probably added during the first half of the nineteenth century and they help to emphasise the rhythm of the arcade.  However, these may have been added during the reconstruction c. 1925.  This building is an integral element of the built heritage of Granard and has played an important role in the social and economic history of the town.  Lewis (1837) records that ‘The market, in which corn, provisions, and coarse linens are sold, is on Monday; and fairs are held on May 3rd, and Oct. 1st. Petty sessions are held every Thursday.  The market house, over which is a courtroom, is a large building in the centre of the town’.  It was a 'butter and potato' market in 1894 (Slater's Directory).  The present market house replaced an earlier market house at Granard, which dated to the seventeenth century.",1770,1800,Regional,market house,233236,280980,633180,780997,53.77749407,-7.496611061,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13305027_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13305027,SURV018

It retains much of its salient fabric and its early character.  The ground floor is enhanced by the tripartite window openings with block-and-start surrounds, which complement the ornate doorway.  The fine architraved tripartite doorcase is well detailed and provides a central focus to this imposing structure.  The finely cut limestone steps to the entrance underlines the status of this hotel as one of the grandest buildings on Main Street.  The hipped roof to the west end, adjoining the former market house (13305027), suggests that it was originally at the end of the terrace and that it may well predate the adjoining building, built c. 1780.  It was in the ownership of an Edward Cahill in 1881 (Slater’s Directory) and probably a Thomas Moxham in 1846 (Slater’s Directory 1846).  It was in the ownership of the Kiernan family during the early-twentieth century.  It has important historical connections with Michael Collins (1890 – 1922), who first stayed at the hotel in 1917 and became a regular visitor to the town between 1917 and 1922.  Collins was engaged to Kitty Kiernan, the daughter of the hotel owner at the time.  The hotel was apparently burnt down by the Black and Tans in 1920, during the War of Independence.  Part of the first floor was in use as magistrates and barristers 'rooms' associated with the adjacent market house and court house during the mid- to late-nineteenth century, entered through a 'convenient doorway' in the party wall (Slater's Directory).",1770,1790,Regional,house,233245,280986,633189,781003,53.77754888,-7.496464476,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13305028_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13305028,SURV018

The embankment to the rear was built to allow for the easy loading of limestone through an opening in the roof structure.  Lime kilns appear to have come into popular use in Ireland during the eighteenth century and were once quite a common feature in the rural landscape.  They were used to burn limestone to produce lime, which was used in construction/building as a mortar and a render, or to produce a fertilizer, which was then spread on agricultural land.  Lime was also used for lime-washing buildings, particularly farm buildings, as it was regarded as a cleansing agent at the time.

It is of interminable age and probably incorporates the fabric of earlier churches to site.  It survives in good condition and retains much of its early form and character.

The carved limestone memorial plaques (one dated 1737) to the north elevation of the nave add artistic and historic incident to an otherwise blank façade.  The rather squat tower with a battered base creates an interesting and distinctive profile and it may be of considerable antiquity.  The slated spire was added in 1811 to designs by Richard Lovell Edgeworth (1744 – 1817).  Lewis (1837) records that it was erected using a ‘gift of £150 and a loan of £500 from the Board of First Fruits (1711 - 1833), although the Irish Parliamentary Returns (1837) states that the church was enlarged in 1810 at an expense of £522, of which £276 was a loan from the Board of First Fruits with £251 raised by parochial assessment.  This spire was apparently built on the ground and was hoisted into place.  It was replaced in 1935.  The vestry, round-headed openings, the stained glass windows and probably the bowed apsidal chancel are late-nineteenth century additions, added 1888 – 89 (cost £430).  The stained glass windows are of artistic merit and they are of a type more commonly found in Roman Catholic churches of the same date.  The grounds of the church contains an interesting collection of cut stone grave markers, including the family vault of the Edgeworth family (which houses the remains of the celebrated author Maria Edgeworth (1767 – 1849), which is a ‘table’ type monument surrounded by simple wrought-iron railings.  The earliest legible grave marker is dated 1705.  The graveyard also, strangely, has a memorial to the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ardagh, Rev.

Gateway and gate lodge (13309024) to the west.","Despite extensive alteration and multiple modern additions, this former country house retains much of its early character, form and its historical importance.  The Doric porch adds a central focus to the main façade.  It was originally built c. 1725 by Richard Edgeworth and it may incorporate an earlier Edgeworth house to site (built or lived in by his father Francis Edgeworth, c. 1695).  Its form and plan are confusing on account of multiple historic alterations, particularly by Richard Lovell Edgeworth (1744 – 1817) during the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries.  Richard was a noted inventor, cartographer, mathematician and an amateur architect, and he carried out various quirky experiments with the layout of the house.  It previously had curved bowed windows where the box bay windows are now present.  The house has important historical connections with Maria Edgeworth (1767 – 1849), the celebrated author.  During the early-nineteenth century the house welcomed many distinguished visitors, including Sir Walter Scott, William Wordsworth and Oliver Goldsmith.  The house was altered during the late-nineteenth century, perhaps at the same time works were carried out on the outbuilding (13309028) to the northeast, c. 1884.  It was later inherited by Mrs C.F. Montague in 1925, a relative of the Edgeworth family.  It was sold in 1935 to a Mr. Noonan, who later donated the house and fifty acres to the Sisters of Mercy c. 1947.  During the Second World War it was occupied by units of the Irish Army.

It is well built using high quality ashlar limestone masonry, while the graceful profile of the arches identifies the civil engineering heritage significance of the site.  The rounded/U-shaped cutwaters are typical of the many bridges built across the River Shannon by the Shannon Navigation Commissioners during the mid-nineteenth century.  It was probably built to designs by Thomas Rhodes (1789 – 1868), the chief engineer with the Shannon Navigation Commissioners at the time of construction and the engineer responsible for a number of elegant bridges over the Shannon.  This bridge formerly had a metal swivel section to the west end, which was built to allow for the passage of river traffic along the Shannon Navigation.  It was later replaced by a fixed span, c. 1975.  The present bridge replaced an earlier nine-arch stone bridge on this site, which was erected Sir George Lane in 1667.

It is typical of late nineteenth-century Church of Ireland churches in that it has a bellcote rather than a tower, a shallow chancel and an entrance porch attached to one side of the nave.  It is well-built using snecked limestone and has good quality cut and dressed stone detailing throughout, particularly to the bellcote and to the openings.  It was built to designs by Joseph Welland (1798 – 1860), architect to the Board of First Fruits (1711 - 1833) and subsequently to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners where he had responsibility for all Church of Ireland building projects from c. 1843 until his death.  Casey and Rowan (1993) describe this church as a ‘classic example of this architect's Puginesque work on a small scale’.  The present church is built on the site of a number of earlier churches and/or an abbey.  An ‘abbey’ here was converted into a church (apparently c. 1678, built by George Lane the first Viscount Lanesborough) and Farrell in his history of County Longford (1881, 333; taken from James Norris Brewer (1826) 'The Beauties of Ireland') records the nave of the present church was ‘formed from the nave of an ancient structure’.  This church was badly damaged in 1691 by factions returning from the Battle of the Boyne, with much of the nave and the tower being damaged.  It was not repaired until 1740, at the direction of the bishop, and only partial repairs were carried out. However, there is no evidence in the present church to suggest that fabric from the earlier church was built into the present structure.  There are a number of architectural fragments in the grounds from this earlier edifice, including an arch (LF017-003008-) built into the boundary wall, a graveslab (LF017-003006-) dated 1690, dedicated to Edmond Banan, to the south of the church and a carved plaque with the coat of arms of the first Viscount Lanesborough to the interior of the church.  The present church was dedicated on the 23th April, 1862.  The bell was cast by the firm Sheridan’s at their Eagle Foundry in Church Street, Dublin.  It was presented to the church by Col. Henry White M. P. (of Rathcline) in 1859. The words “Erin go Brath” are embossed around the harp.  The attention to detail found at this church is carried through to the well-detailed gate piers and gates.  The simple rubble limestone boundary walls and the fine collection of grave markers complete the setting of this appealing composition.

A church is indicated on this site on the Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map of the area in 1838.  The 1859 construction or remodelling has been attributed to William Hague Senior (1806 – 1888), a Cavan builder and father of the famous architect of the same name.  This 1859 work probably resulted in the church taking on the familiar hall and tower form.

Located to the north of Lanesborough.","Lanesborough power plant, which was built in three stages, owes its construction to the establishment of the Turf Development Board in 1934.  The State relied heavily on turf as a source of energy during the 1930’s and on local farmers who derived part of their living by cutting and supplying sod turf to ESB.  In 1946 the Government decided to embark on a programme of expansion and consequently founded a new semi-state body, Bord na Móna.  It was given extensive powers to acquire and develop bog land for use as an indigenous fuel.  The Lanesborough plant is a fine example of mid-to-late twentieth century Government sponsored functional architecture and it is, perhaps, the largest structure ever built in County Longford.  The functional design of the power plant owes much to the early twentieth century architectural styles of the Bauhaus and the work of Le Corbusier and it is constructed using the most modern materials available at the time.  The flat-roofed forms and the strong horizontal emphasis of the strip glazing are also typical of the date of construction.

The church is constructed with high quality limestone masonry walls, with slightly battered walls, which enhance the form of the church and give it a vaguely stocky appearance.  The decorative rather than functional buttresses add further interest to the façade; they are finely carved and aptly illustrate the quality of early nineteenth-century masons.  It was ‘ rebuilt’ in 1837 by aid of a grant of £1211 from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners (Lewis 1837).

The retention of early quarry glazed windows in a notable feature.  This building was apparently originally built in the 1830s by the local Church of Ireland dean/rector as a Church of Ireland primary school.  Lewis (1837) records that the school at Ardagh is a ‘good slated building of two stories with apartments for the master and mistress erected by Dr. Murray at an expense of £400’.  According to local tradition/folklore, this building was in use as a ‘souper school’ during the Great Famine (1845 – c. 1849) and local Roman Catholic families were offered food here if they converted to the Protestant faith.  The school was later brought into the national school system from 1892 until 1938 when a new school was constructed.  Its unusual axis in relation to the current line road is noteworthy.  This is due to a realignment of the road as part of Rawson Carroll’s (1830 – 1911) work in the village during the 1860s.  This building is a worthy addition to the built heritage of Ardagh and is of social interest to the local area as a former school.

It is very well composed and well massed, and is richly ornamented throughout with cut stone carving of the very highest quality.  The contrast between the yellow sandstone masonry and the grey limestone detailing creates a highly picturesque composition.  It was built to designs by William Hague (1836 – 1899), an eminent church architect of his day, and this church at Ardagh is considered to be amongst his best work.  While the quality of design, building materials and finishes are immediately apparent; it is only on viewing the interior that a complete picture of this accomplishment by Hague can be assessed.  Of particular note are the wall mosaics, due not only to their attractiveness and complexity, but also to their relative rarity in this country.  The treatment of utilitarian features is an indication of the attention to detailing that this structure received, the excellent and functional rainwater goods and radiators are all significant in their own right.  Beautiful carvings in Irish and Italian marble are incorporated in the interior, in particular the high altar and altar rail, which were designed by William Hague and apparently carved by James Pearse (1839 - 1900), father of the sculptor Willie Pearse and the more famous political figure Patrick Pearse (1879 - 1916).  The tower and spire were completed c. 1903 by T.F. McNamara (1867 - 1947), partner of Hague and an accomplished and prolific architect in his own right.  The impressive stained glass to the east window (Sacred Heart) is by Mayer and Co. of Munich, a renowned firm whose work can be seen at many churches in Ireland, both Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland.  It was added in 1919.  The west window is also by Mayer and Co. of Munich but its date is uncertain.  Other stained glass windows are by J. Watson and Co. of Youghal, County Cork.  This church was originally commissioned by Archdeacon James Reynolds and was completed under Monsignor James O’Farrell.  It replaced an earlier 'T-plan' Roman Catholic chapel at Ardagh, which was located to the east of the present site in the townland of Cross.  The church was consecrated in 1905.  This magnificent church dominates the east approach into Ardagh and is one of the more important elements of the architectural heritage of County Longford.",1878,1903,National,church/chapel,220440,268506,620386,768526,53.66608387,-7.691523586,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13312031_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13312031,SURV018

Separate record for entrance (13312010).  Located to the centre of Ardagh.","This slightly quirky but appealing Church of Ireland church retains its early form and character.  It retains much of its important early fabric and fine craftsmanship is apparent in the carving and detailing.  The front elevation (west) is particularly interesting with a mix of classical (cornice and frieze) and Gothic detailing.  The side vestibules are a feature that is found at a number of the Church of Ireland churches in County Longford.  The form of this church conforms to typical Board of First Fruits (1711- 1833) two/three-bay hall and tower form that can be found in great numbers throughout the Irish countryside.  The detailing of the tracery to the nave windows suggests that these were altered during the second half of the nineteenth century, perhaps to designs by the architect James Rawson Carroll (1830 – 1911), who carried out extensive works in Ardagh between c. 1860 – 1865.  It cost £1809 to build, and Lewis (1837) records that the church at Ardagh is ‘a plain commodious building with a square tower, for the erection of which the late Board of First Fruits granted a loan of £900, in 1812, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have lately granted £301 for its repair’.  Its elevated position and prominent site in the village makes it a dominant feature in the surrounding landscape.  This church was a cathedral church for a period during the early nineteenth-century, until the Dioceses of Ardagh and Kilmore were united in 1839.  It forms part of an interesting group of related structures with the associated rectory (13312008) and the lychgate (13312010) at the entrance to the church.  The graveyard contains a number of good quality grave markers, the earliest of which is dated 1818.  To the southeast are the remains of St. Mel’s cathedral (LF019-05101-), a single-cell chapel on rectangular-plan dating from the early medieval period.  This church has a lintelled doorway to the west gable wall and projecting antae to the east and west gable ends, which is a characteristic feature of early stone church buildings in Ireland.  This is also possibly/probably the site of a church founded by St. Mel in the fifth century.  The present church replaced an earlier parish church (13312037) at Ardagh, which is sited a short distance to the northwest.",1805,1815,Regional,church/chapel,220329,268636,620275,768655,53.66725056,-7.693195755,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13312032_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13312032,SURV018

Advanced bay with single-storey canted bay window to south elevation.  Late-twentieth century single-storey extension to rear (west).

Situated adjacent to, and within the grounds of St. Brigid's Roman Catholic church.  Separate record for entrance group to the parochial house (13312049).  Located to the east of Ardagh.","This substantial parochial house is associated with St. Brigid's Roman Catholic church (13312031) not only in its proximity, but also visually through the choice of building materials and finishes.  The unusual trio of stained glass windows (probably indicating a chapel), and the carved doorcase continue the theme.  High quality craftsmanship is apparent throughout, and the varied elevations create the appropriate liveliness.  Its deliberate asymmetry is typical of many substantial late-Victorian and Edwardian structures.  The juxtaposition between the rock-faced yellow sandstone construction and the gray limestone detailing creates an interesting tonal and textural variation to the facades.  This parochial house was built under the direction of Monsignor James O’Farrell  to designs by T.F.

This building has important historical connections with the Fetherston family, who developed much the village of Ardagh, particularly in the 1860s.  The first recorded mention of the Fetherston family at Ardagh is of a Thomas Fetherston (died c. 1749), who bought a house and 235 acres of land in 1703.  The Fetherston estate was some 11,000 acres in size by c. 1900.  It is thought that Thomas Fetherston built Ardagh House (or an earlier house) sometime during the first half of the eighteenth century, perhaps c. 1730.  The house was in existence in 1744/5 when Oliver Goldsmith (c. 1728 – 1774) visited the house.  Apparently, Goldsmith based his most famous play ‘She Stoops to Conquer’ on his experience at Ardagh House, when he mistook the house for an inn/hotel.  However, Lewis (1837) states that the play in question is ‘Mistakes of a Night’.  The Fetherston were later granted the rank of Baronet in 1780.  There was an Ardagh House in existence c. 1780 (Taylor and Skinner maps 1777 – 1783).  John Hargrave (1788 – 1833) carried out ‘trifling alterations for Sir George Fetherston’, c. 1826 (IAA).  James Rawson Carroll (1830 – 1911) later carried out extensive ‘alterations, repairs and additions’ for Sir Thomas John Fetherston, between c. 1860 – 1864.  Plasterwork was carried out in 1877 for the Fetherston Trustees (the fifth Baronet, Revd. Sir George Ralph Fetherston had moved to Wales).  In 1903 Sir George sold the freehold of their farms to over 300 of his tenants under the Irish Land Act of 1903 but retained the house and the surrounding lands until his death in 1923.  The house was partially destroyed by fire in 1922 during Irish Civil War (1922 – 1923).  It was sold to the Sisters of Mercy in 1927, who then established a convent and domestic science school here.  The house was again badly destroyed by fire in 1948 and the top floor had to be removed as a result.  This building forms the centrepiece of a large group of related sites and is an important element of the social history of Ardagh and County Longford.",1730,1865,Regional,country house,220276,268842,620223,768862,53.66910948,-7.693973573,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13312039_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13312039,SURV018

Main house (13314005) to the south.","A substantial outbuilding and stableyard complex of classical proportions, retaining its elegant early nineteenth-century character and form.  The design of this outbuilding complex was conceived as an integral part of the overall layout of the Doory Hall (13314005) estate.  It retains much of its early fabric, including timber sash and cast-iron multi-paned windows.  The imposing design of the main facade, incorporating a pedimented breakfront flanked by lower wings, echoes the façade of Doory Hall itself.  It may have been built to designs by John Hargrave (1788 – 1833), the architect responsible for the designs of the ‘new’ Doory Hall, c. 1820, which replaced an earlier house(s) to site.  Its scale provides an indication of the former wealth of the Doory Hall estate and gives an interesting historical insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a large country estate in Ireland during the nineteenth century.  The presence of chimneystacks in the ranges of outbuildings suggests that these structures had an additional domestic function/workshop function, possibly accommodating labourers and stable hands.  Lewis (1837) mentions ‘a school at Doory Hall, supported by Mrs. Jessop’ and, perhaps, one of these buildings formerly had that function.  The building to the northwest end of the main block may have been used for this purpose.  This range of outbuildings is one of the surviving demesne structures on the Doory Hall estate and forms an integral part of an interesting group in the landscape.  It is an important element of the architectural heritage of County Longford in its own right.  The Doory Hall estate has historical connections with the Jessop family, originally from Derbyshire, who were granted extensive lands here by King Charles II in the late seventeenth century on lands previously owned by the O’Farrell family.  A Doory Hall was in existence in 1714 when a marriage between a Robert Fetherston of Ardagh House (13312039) and an Elizabeth Jessop of Doory Hall is recorded.  There is a ‘Dury Hall’, in the ownership of Jessop Esq., indicated on the Taylor and Skinner map of 1777 – 1783.

The carriage entrance to the party wall, which is constructed with high quality cut stone masonry, adds further aesthetic qualities to this complex.  The red brick lining the walls to the southeast garden suggests that this area contained an orchard.  The walled gardens in a demesne were not only an important source of food for the main house, but also provided pleasure gardens for the inhabitants to enjoy.  In this particular example a walkway from Doory Hall leads through a row of elm trees, known as ""The Elm Walk"", to the attractive southeast entrance gate and into the gardens.

The rock-faced voussoirs to the central arch suggest that it was rebuilt later, perhaps during the mid-nineteenth century.

Set back from the road to the centre of Ballymahon.","This building, by the architect Samuel Mullen, was designed to fulfill two specific roles, that of court house and market house.  The market house was situated on the ground floor and the court house, including solicitor's and judge's rooms and courtroom, was located on the first floor.  The form and design reflects this double function with carriage arches to the ground floor essential for the market house, which are reflected above in the recessed panels forming a coherent and unified decorative scheme.  The breakfront and classical features lend an air of authority to the structure befitting its original purposes.  The sculpted limestone plaque to the pediment, bearing the coat of arms of the Shuldham family, local landowners who erected the building, and the carved voussoirs and keystones adds artistic interest to the façade and were clearly carved by skilled craftsmen.  The market house reflects the growing economic prosperity of Ballymahon in the early nineteenth century.  Occupying a prominent site, set back from the street, this building is a notable and imposing feature on the main street of Ballymahon.  Samuel Mullen also designed the Church of Ireland church (13316019) in Ballymahon.  The original design among the Shuldham papers suggests that the roof was intended to support a central clocktower and a slated canopy ran around the building at first floor level.  The interior of the courtroom was altered c. 1880.  Slater's Directory (1846) indicates that the building was opened in 1826.

Its layout is typical of the standard hall and tower church, which were built in great numbers, particularly between 1808 - 1830, using loans and grants from the Board of First Fruits (1722 - 1833).  These small, simple, but well-built churches have become almost iconographic features of the Irish countryside.

Built or rebuilt to designs by the Dublin architect Samuel Mullen, who also designed the court house/market house (13316010) in Ballymahon.  It displays a high level of attention to detail in both its design and execution, the result of a grant of £1140 by the Board of First Fruits in 1824 (Lewis 1837) for the extension and alteration of the pre-existing church, a simple structure built c. 1800.  It is likely that the tower and spire were added as part of the 1824 alterations.  Repairs and alterations were also effected in 1890.  The surrounding graveyard contains an interesting collection of grave markers, the earliest of which is dated 1774, hinting that the present church occupies the site of an earlier edifice.  The Shuldham family plot is located to the southwest corner of the graveyard.  The Shuldham family developed much of the town of Ballymahon during the early-nineteenth century and funded the construction of the court house/market house in the town.

It is unusually large for a rural school, which is indicative of its former importance to the area (see below).  It retains many original features which enhance the façade such as the slate roof with ornate ridge crestings and terracotta finials.  The end bays to the east are obviously a later extension as the ridge crestings are of a different style and the overall symmetry of the building is disrupted.  This extension, however, provides important social context to the site, as it may have been extended to accommodate more pupils (extended between 1949 - 51).  The dormer windows are particularly ornate and unusual, with finely carved timber bargeboards surmounted by decorative terracotta finials that provide artistic interest.  Prominently sited, this former school provides a pleasing roadside feature in the rural landscape to the north of County Longford.  This building was originally built in 1897 as a ‘Latin School’, where Latin and Greek were thought to boys intending to train for the priesthood.  ‘The Latin School’ apparently had its origins as a hedge school during the Penal times, and later teaching took place in various houses, barns and an earlier school at Moyne until the present structure was built.  It became a mixed school in 1967 and closed as a school in 1974, when Moyne Community College was constructed nearby.  It is now in use as a community centre (since 1983), continuing its social importance to the local community.  This building was built on the site of a Roman Catholic chapel (built 1818), and stone from this chapel was used in the construction of the school.  This chapel went out of use following the construction of St. Mary’s church (13400209) to the northeast, c. 1865.",1890,1900,Regional,school,223917,295291,623863,795305,53.90657872,-7.636845391,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13400208_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13400208,SURV018

The large window and door openings are typical of the early-twentieth century, and the fanlight in particular is interesting, having an unusual heart motif.  Although it has lost some of its fabric, it has an appropriate render and retains natural roof slates.  It is enhanced and contextualised by the outbuildings to the yard to the rear, and a garden wall with attractive wrought-iron pedestrian gate.

Fifteenth-century cast-bronze bell to interior.  Set back from road in extensive grounds to the northwest of Granard.  Rendered and rubble stone boundary walls.  Wrought-iron railings over rendered wall to the north boundary.  Graveyard to site with collection of mainly upstanding grave markers.","This substantial Roman Catholic church dominates the Aghnacliff area.  It was originally built during the early nineteenth-century chapel but it was extensively remodelled and altered in 1934 (on the occasion of the centenary of its original construction) and now has a primarily mid-twentieth-century character.  The form and structure of this building is enhanced by moulded render surrounds to the door and window openings, and by the render quoins and buttresses.  Its height is emphasised by the corner pinnacles to the tower and by the buttresses that flank it to either side.  The interior has a subdued classical character on account of the round-headed arcades to the side aisles and the round-headed window openings, and the shallow barrel-vaulted ceiling (part of 1934 alterations).  The stained glass window of St. Columbkille landing at Iona is notable for its use of insular interlace motifs, including animal head interlace, and its depiction of fine metalwork.  This window is of artistic merit and creates a focal point to the chancel.  The graveyard contains a collection of mainly upstanding grave markers of nineteenth and twentieth-century date, some with wrought or cast-iron railings.  Some of the grave markers are finely carved (particularly a number of Celtic high cross-type examples) and are of some artistic merit.  The earliest grave marker is dated November 1811, which suggests that there was an earlier church at this site prior to the original construction of the present church in 1834.  The cast-bronze bell to the interior of the church probably dates to the fifteenth century, and was possibly taken from the now ruinous ecclesiastical site on Inchmore Island in Lough Gowna, traditional associated with St. Columbkille.  This bell has a Latin inscription (M+AGISTER OM[X]-[T]HA?) and is of a form that suggests that it was originally made in Italy (Florentine Form).  The church is also built on the site of a possible circular enclosure (LF006-072---), which is indicated on Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map (1838) and designated ‘fort’, adding further archaeological interest to this site.

Its form suggest that it was originally built as a two classroom school, possibly with separate classrooms for boys and girls as was common practice at the time of construction.  The school retains many original features that enhance the façade and add a patina of age such as the slate roof, timber sash windows and the carved limestone plaques, one with Gaelic script.  This plaque was probably moved from its original location after the flat-roofed extension was constructed.

Main gateway to the southwest of site, comprising a pair of gently battered dressed limestone gate piers (on square-plan) having gabled slated caps and decorative double-leaf iron gates.","This interesting and quite quirky church building retains its original character and form.  The slightly battered walls and the round-headed openings lend this building a vaguely Hiberno-Romanesque feel.  The unusual stepped crenellations to the tower and the sacristy are reminiscent of the Irish style crenellations found on some tower houses.  This church was built to designs by Ralph Henry Byrne (1877 - 1946), a prominent architect of his day noted for his academic, and rather eclectic, approach to architectural design.  The sacristy at this church is very similar to that at the Byrne-designed church of the Four Masters in Donegal Town, built 1931 – 35.  It was built by Father Peter Murtagh and cost £7,700 to build.  The church was dedicated on 5th October 1941 by Bishop McNamee.  The carefully cut and carved stone to the walls of this church at Cloonagh is unusual in a twentieth-century building, even a public high-status one such as a church.  While it was built in the thirties, it reused stone from a earlier three-storey country house, Derrycassan House, the former seat of the Dopping family (later the Dopping-Hepenstal family post 1858), which was located a short distance to the west (overlooking Lough Gowna).  Derrycassan House was, reputedly, itself built using stone from the ecclesiastic site on Inchmore on Lough Gowna.  The Dopping family came to Ireland c. 1640 and owned lands in Longford from c. 1720 at the latest (Dopping-Hepenstal papers National Library of Ireland).  The limestone quoins and voussoirs provide textural and colour contrast to the smaller blocks of snecked sandstone used in the walls.  Its height and form make it a significant landmark in the rural landscape of north County Longford, and it is an important element of the built heritage of the area.  The present church replaced an earlier Roman Catholic church/chapel that was located a short distance to the north.  This was built in 1832 and was demolished after the present edifice was built.

The heads to the window and door openings may be later additions, perhaps added by the Forbes family to create a ‘romantic’ ruin/eye-catcher within the demesne grounds.  The vault to the interior of the church is probably associated with the Forbes family, adding additional historical importance to this site.  The site of the church is considerable enhanced by the collection of interesting and well-crafted cut stone grave markers, some of which are of artistic merit.  The majority of the legible inscriptions to the grave markers date to the eighteenth century.  There are also a number of roughly-hewn uninscribed grave markers.  The simple iron entrance gates to the southeast complete the setting of this interesting site, which forms an important part of an extensive collection of sites associated with Castle Forbes (13303001), and is an integral element of the architectural and archaeological heritage of the Newtown-Forbes area.  This church is thought to be an earlier parish church serving Clonguish and it may be the site of the church that is thought to have been founded in this vicinity by St. Ailither (Archaeological Survey).

Set back from road, adjacent to Ennybegs Community Centre, and to the west of Ballinalee.","This simple Roman Catholic church/chapel retains much of its early character and form, despite a number of phases of alteration.  It dates to 1828 (date plaque) and it was (probably) originally built on a T-shaped plan (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838), which is characteristic of Roman Catholic churches built in Ireland before and immediately after Catholic Emancipation in 1829.  Built in the vernacular tradition without any special architectural features and with the bare minimum of ornament to the openings, this church is representative of a great many Roman Catholic churches in rural Ireland c. 1820 to c. 1840.  It was originally built by Rev. John O’Reilly, Parish Priest of Killoe.  The clasping buttresses give it a robust profile and strong presence for such a low-profile and small-scale structure.  The chancel was added by c. 1900 (map information), while a plaque to the belltower/belfry suggests that this was built in 1957.  The flat roof, simple form and the fluted columns to the open belfry lend it a muted Modernist feel.  However, the bell itself may have come from an earlier freestanding belfry to site.  This church does not conform to the usual east-west plan/arrangement normally associated with rural churches.  This hints that it might contain the fabric of an earlier hall-type church with an altar along the long axis, a earlier Roman Catholic church form (late-eighteenth/early-nineteenth century) that is sometimes found in rural Ireland, mostly commonly as part of an enlarged church.  Indeed a ‘cross’ is indicated in this location on the Edgeworth map of 1814, suggesting that this is the site of an earlier church building.

Rubble sandstone boundary wall to site having paired limestone gate posts with looped wrought-iron flat bar gates.  Located to the east of Ballinalee, adjacent to rural road junction.","Despite extensive recent renovations, this appealing small-scale former forge/smithy retains its early character and form.  The form of this building, with the wide opening adjacent to the road, is indicative of its original use as a forge.  It represents an interesting relic of Irish rural society before the widespread introduction of the motor car made forges largely redundant.  This small-scale structure is of particular significance due to its important historical connections with General Sean MacEoin (1893 – 1973), the ‘Blacksmith of Ballinalee’.  General MacEoin is famous for his exploits with the North Longford Flying Column of the Longford Brigade between c. 1917 and c. 1921, particularly the engagements with the British at Ballinalee in November 1920 and at the Clonfin ambush in February 1921.  After the Battle of Ballinalee, the house (footings still survive adjacent to the forge) and forge were set on fire by the Black and Tans.  McEoin later directed activity against anti-Treaty forces during the Civil War (1922 – 23), particularly in the Mayo and Sligo areas, and was appointed as Quartermaster General of the Irish Army in March 1927, and then Chief of Staff in February 1929.  MacEoin served as a TD in the Longford - Westmeath constituency (1932 – 37, 1948 – 65) and in Athlone-Longford (1937 – 48) until he was defeated in the 1965 general election.  During a long and distinguished political career he served as Minister for Justice (February 1948–March 1951) and Minister for Defence (March – June 1951 and June 1954 – March 1957).  He stood twice as candidate for the Presidency, against Seán T. O’Kelly in 1945, and Eamon de Valera in 1959, but was defeated on both occasions.  The forge at Ballinalee survived and continued to be operated by Sean’s brother, Micheal, throughout the mid-twentieth century.  It fell into disuse but restoration work on it was carried out under a FAS scheme for the centenary of MacEoin’s birth in 1993.",1900,1920,Regional,forge/smithy,223999,280720,623945,780737,53.77566679,-7.636733652,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13400905_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13400905,SURV018

This building provides an interesting historical insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a large country estate in Ireland during the nineteenth century.  This building once formed part of a substantial complex of outbuildings associated with Currygrane House, now demolished.  It is the main surviving structure associated with this former country estate, the seat of the Wilson family (Baronets from 1919), which was demolished in the 1920s.  It forms a pair of related structures along with the pet cemetery (13400909) to the northwest, and is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.  The Wilson family was an important family that arrived in Ireland during the late-seventeenth century and had their roots in Scotland.  William Hague (1836 - 1910), an eminent architect of his day, carried out extensive alterations to Currygrane House in 1866 – 8 (Irish Architectural Archive), which is possibly when the Wilson family moved here.  Sir Thomas Drew (1838 - 1910) also carried out works at Currygrane c. 1900.  James Wilson of Currygrane had an estate of 1,158 acres in the 1870s.  Currygrane House was burnt down in 1922, when James Mackay Wilson, a noted antiquarian, was in residence. James' brother, Sir Henry Hughes Wilson, 1st Baronet, (1864 – 1922; either born at Currygrane or in Dublin) was a field marshal in the British Army and an eminent Conservative Party politician.  In 1918, he was made Chief of the Imperial General Staff of the British Army and later acted as Britain’s chief military advisor at the Paris Peace Conference after the end of World War One.  He was assassinated by the IRA in London in 1922.  In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, King George V sent his equerry to the Wilson’s London address (Eaton Place) to convey the royal sympathy to Lady Wilson.  Wilson's funeral was a public affair attended by the Prime Minister Lloyd George and the cabinet, as well as many of his former army colleagues.  Wilson was buried in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, in a prominent position between Lord Roberts and Lord Wolseley.  There is a fine memorial monument to Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson at Liverpool Street Station, London.  Currygrane was the earlier the home of a W. L.

Roughly dressed rubble stone boundary walls, lined with red brick to interior face.  Brick coping over walls.  Round- and segmental-headed niches/blind openings at intervals to interior, probably originally integral pedestrian entrances.  Segmental-headed carriage arch entrance to the southeast end of enclosure having projecting dressed limestone surrounds to the exterior face and rubble stone vestibules/projections to the interior, flanking arch, with loop hole/slit openings having splayed dressed limestone surrounds.  Original gates now removed.  Wrought-iron revolving pedestrian/turnstile gate located adjacent to main entrance (moved from another location).  Three-bay two-storey former gardener’s house (13400911) built into walled garden to the northwest side, flush with inner face of wall.  Located to the northwest of Carrigglas Manor (13401414) and to the northeast of Longford Town.","Despite being out of use for a considerable period of time, this walled garden retains its original form.  It survives in good condition apart from some isolated areas of damage, mainly to the coping.  Its oval plan is unusual and differs from the rectangular-plan walled gardens much more commonly encountered on Irish country estates.  The brick bond using in the inner face is also quite unusual in that it is a hybrid of the Flemish Bond and the English Garden Bond (the most common brick bond found in walled gardens).  This walled garden probably dates to the extensive works carried out at Carrigglas Manor for the Glendowe-Newcomen family between c. 1792 and 1804.  It forms a pair of structures with the elegant former gardener’s house (13400911) built into northwest side of the walled garden, and is an important element in a wider group of related structures associated with Carrigglas Manor (13401414).  This walled garden was formerly divided into four unequal quadrants by two axial pathways (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838), with another pathway running around the perimeter.  The form of the garden at this time, as depicted on the 1838 map, suggests that it was partially in use as a pleasure garden.  Two glasshouses formerly stood to the northwest side of the walled enclosure, flanking the former gardener’s house (Ordnance Survey third edition six-inch map 1913).  This walled garden provides an interesting historical insight into the extensive resources needed to run and maintain a large country estate in Ireland during the late-eighteenth and the nineteenth century, and is an important element of the built heritage of County Longford.",1790,1810,Regional,walled garden,216156,277655,616104,777673,53.74843235,-7.755850796,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13400913_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13400913,SURV018

Entrance to Roman Catholic graveyard to the west comprising a pair of dressed limestone gate piers (on square-plan) having dressed limestone capstones and wrought-iron flat bar gates.  Wrought-iron turnstile gate located adjacent to gateway to the northwest.  Site located on elevated ground to the southwest of Ballinalee.","An attractive early nineteenth-century Church of Ireland church, built in a Gothic Revival style, which retains its early form, character and fabric.  Although now vacant, its salient features remain intact.  It is well-built using very high quality dressed limestone masonry that is almost ashlar in quality and has extensive cut stone detailing throughout, particularly to the openings and to the tower.  The rather austere elevations are enlivened by the wide window openings that retain timber intersecting tracery and early quarry glazing.  This building is notable for its unusually large tower to the west, which gives this building a striking silhouette and a strong presence in the rural landscape to the southwest of Ballinalee.  Its cruciform-plan differs from the more commonly encountered hall and tower-type Church of Ireland churches built/funded by the Board of First Fruits in rural Ireland.  Lewis (1829) records that this church was built in 1824 using a gift of £900 from the Board of First Fruits and £200 from Willoughby Bond, Esq., of Farragh/Farraghroe House to the south.  This work may have been carried out to designs by John Hargrave (1788 – 1833) (Irish Architectural Archive), who was responsible for the fine Church of Ireland church at Ballinalee (13304009), a short distance to the northeast.  This church at Ballinalee was built in 1825 and shares a number of features with the church here at Killoe, including the wide window openings with intersecting tracery and the moulded eaves course.  Hargrave also designed a house at nearby Farragh/Farraghroe for Willoughby Bond (Irish Architectural Archive).  Alterations (‘sundry works’) to the church at Killoe took place in 1861 to designs by Gillespie and Welland, the joint architects of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners (Irish Architectural Archive).  Map information (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838 and Ordnance Survey third edition six-inch map 1913) suggest that the tower was probably added as part of these ‘sundry works’ as the earlier map depicts the church as T-plan.  The church is surrounded by two graveyards, a Church of Ireland graveyard surrounding the church and a Roman Catholic graveyard to the north, which contain an interesting collection of upstanding, recumbent and box memorials, some of which are finely carved and of artistic merit.  The earliest legible grave marker to the Roman Catholic graveyard dates to 1741, suggesting the presence of an earlier church to site.  Indeed, a church is marked at Killoe (LF009-026001-/LF009-026002-) on the Down Survey map of Killoe dating from 1654.  The surrounding boundary walls, gateways and the ruinous single-storey building to the east contribute substantially to the church's setting, which represents one of the most appealing buildings of its type and date in County Longford.

The front elevation is enlivened by the fine Palladian doorcase, which is of high artistic merit.  This doorcase is of a type popularised by a pattern book published by William Pain in 1758.  This doorcase may have been brought to this house from another location (local information - Clonfin suggested).  The removal of the render to the front façade has exposed evidence of at least three phases of construction.  Wide window openings, of a type popular in the early-nineteenth century, were inserted to the ground floor, probably c. 1820.  These wide window openings probably accommodated Wyatt-type tripartite timber sash windows.  The central window at first floor level may also have been widened at this date.  The width of the front elevation was also extended, possibly at the same time.  The roofline was also altered at this time to accommodate this extension, creating a sprocketed profile.  This extension of the front façade changed the building from a modest three-bay two-storey house/farmhouse into something altogether more grand.  The window openings were later infilled, perhaps c. 1850.  The position of a stairwell, which is located in a wing to the northeast side of the house, is unusual and hints that this building was reorientation from a southwest facing building to a southeast facing building.  The substantial complex of outbuildings to the rear suggests that this was an affluent farm.  The presence of a chimneystack and entrance porch to the exterior façade of the building to the northwest suggests function such as housing labourers or stable hands.  The massive buttresses and stonework to the exterior faces of the walls to the southwest and northwest faces of the outbuildings hints that this building or complex might contain earlier fabric.  This building was formerly in the residence of George Holmes (lease dated 22nd of April 1778), who leased the house from Sir William Gleadow Newcomen (of Carrigglas Manor).  A building somewhere in this vicinity is indicated as the residence of a ‘Holmes, Esq.’ on a Taylor and Skinner road map (1777 – 83).  There is also a record of a marriage of a Jane Holmes, only daughter of Galbraith Holmes of Ballinlough, Co. Longford, High Sheriff, recorded in May 1763.  It was later the residence of a John Irwin, Esq., in 1824 (Pigot’s Directory) and an Edward Irwin in 1846 (Slater’s Directory).  It was in the ownership of a Cornelius Heldon (lease dated 1845) who rented the property to John Irwin at an annual rent of £10.",1760,1800,Regional,house,227554,281966,627500,781983,53.78668652,-7.582699237,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401011_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401011,SURV018

The very fine carved limestone pedimented doorcase with Gibbsian features, and the flight of cut stone steps that precede it, enliven the other wise plain front façade and provide a central focus to this interesting structure.  The unusual proportions to the front elevation, the altered roofline, the massive end chimneystacks, the irregular rhythm of the fenestration to the front elevation and the lack of openings to the  rear elevation, suggests that this house spans many periods and may be of considerable antiquity (perhaps late-seventeenth century).  The simple outbuildings to the rear (particularly the outbuilding to the northeast), the wall to the northeast of the house and the simple gateway to the southeast of the house add considerably to the setting of this composition.  This house and its associated features creates a pleasant group in the rural landscape to the southwest of Granard and is an important element of the architectural heritage of the area.  The earliest located references to Spring Park (Coolagherty) go back as far 1729 when a Lieutenant Claud Beatty and a Captain Charles Beatty were associated with the house (probate will).

It was originally built as a typical early-to-mid nineteenth-century T-plan church/chapel.  However, it was extensively remodelled between 1929 and 1933 to designs by Rudolph Maximilian Butler (1872 – 1943), when the round towers and the sprocketed roof were built, and the circular dormer-type windows were added to the eaves.  The elegant pointed arch timber sliding sash windows are one of the few features that survived the thorough remodelling.  The quirky remodelling was apparently inspired by the Moorish architecture experienced by the then parish priest during his time as a seminarian in Salamanca, Spain.  The attractive figurative stained glass window to the chancel may be the work of the famed Harry Clarke Studios, or perhaps the firm Earley and Sons of Camden Street, Dublin, who worked in a similar style.  Other features of artistic merit to the interior include the marble alter goods, the impressive mosaic work and tiles to the floor, and the timber galleries.  The church is surrounded by a graveyard with mainly upstanding grave markers of nineteenth and twentieth century date.  Some of the grave markers are finely carved and are of artistic merit, particularly a number of Celtic high cross-type memorials.  There is also a Republican grave plot where a number of IRA members who died during the War of Independence are interred.",1820,1935,Regional,church/chapel,225487,277994,625432,778012,53.7511074,-7.61439529,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401029_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401029,SURV018

Located to the west of the site of Kilshruley Manor, and to the west of Granard.  Stone weir (13401031) adjacent to the west.","This interesting bridge was originally associated with the Kilshruley Manor estate (house now demolished).  It is one of the few estate/demesne bridges still extant in County Longford.  The use of steel beams to support the road deck suggests it dates to the end of the nineteenth century, and it replaced a series of three earlier bridge to site that were associated with an ornamental lake and/or mill pond adjacent to the east (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838).  Although damaged, it retains its original form and character.  The piers and abutments are well built using good-quality squared rubble limestone masonry, while the dressed stone string courses to the piers and the surviving quadrant wall adds a formal architectural character.  Its form, having a flat deck supported on steel beams and with stone piers and abutments to either end, is unusual in rural County Longford and it is an interesting addition to the architectural heritage of the local area.  The simple but elegant wrought-iron railings survive in good condition and add further interest.  It acts as an historical reminder of the Kilshruley Manor estate.  Kilshruley Manor has historical connections with a branch of the Edgeworth family, who had their main seat at Edgeworthstown House (13309029) and another seat at Lissard (house demolished).  The Edgeworth family had a house at Kilshruley (or Kilshewly) probably from the late-seventeenth century (the owner of the lands at this time, Sir Robert Edgeworth (1659 – 1730), was knighted by King Charles II in 1672 and later raised a regiment for William III during the wars of 1689 – 92.

The pointed arch openings lend this building a muted Gothic character.  The cut limestone block-and-start surrounds and the fine cut limestone belfry help enliven the otherwise plain exterior.  The shallow canted projection to the east elevation is an unusual feature, and was probably was built to contain a confession box.  The pictorial stained glass windows, particularly the figurative window to the chancel gable (dated 1913), and the marble altar add artistic interest to the interior.  The simple form of this church is typical of Roman Catholic churches of its type and date, and is indicative of the relative lack of resources available to the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland at the time of construction.  The church was extensively renovated to the interior c. 1960, and now has a largely mid-to-late twentieth century appearance (to the interior).

It is a notable example of mid-to-late twentieth century Government sponsored engineering, and it is a conspicuous feature in the rural landscape to the north of Lanesborough.  Its construction utilises modern building materials such as (precast) reinforced concrete in the piers and structural steel for the deck, and it is an interesting addition to the twentieth century built heritage of Longford.  It forms part of an extensive network of narrow gauge railway associated with Bord na Mona in this part of Longford, which is known as the Mountdillion Group of Bogs network.  The railway line was originally used by Bord na Mona to transport sod peat from County Roscommon to the sidings at Lanesborough 'A' Power Station to the south.  ESB’s own locomotives then hauled the wagons to the unloading point.  On the closure of station 'A' in 1983, the system was redirected to supply power stations 'B' and 'C' with milled peat.

The skilled craftsmanship involved in cutting and carving stone to provide channelled rustication and convex U-cutwaters is evident.  The rounded/U-shaped cutwaters are typical of the many bridges built across the River Shannon by the Shannon Navigation Commissioners during the mid-nineteenth century.  It was probably built to designs by Thomas Rhodes (1789 – 1868), the chief engineer with the Shannon Navigation Commissioners at the time of construction and the engineer responsible for a number of elegant bridges over the Shannon (including Lanesborough Bridge 13310001).  This bridge at Termonbarry formerly had a metal swivel section to the west end, which was built to allow for the passage of river traffic along the Shannon Navigation.  It was later replaced by a fixed span, c. 1975.  The present bridge at Termonbarry replaced an earlier multi-span masonry bridge at this site.  The marriage between traditional bridge building techniques and twentieth-century technology create an interesting structural form.  Modern technology such as reinforced concrete and hydraulics create the lifting section of the bridge, which is a notable example of modern engineering.

Originally a two-storey house over a basement with an attic storey and high-pitched roof with two dormer windows (Bence-Jones 1978, 47; Casey and Rowan 1993, 437), its lowered elevation is the result of rebuilding in the 1930's after being partially burnt in 1922.  The late nineteenth-century ballroom to the southeast survived the fire.  Typical of many country houses in Ireland, cut limestone is used to emphasise the architectural form of the house, providing window surrounds, quoins and string courses.  This house is so elaborately decorated that even the basement windows have cut limestone surrounds, and unusual feature for houses of its size.  The entrance is emphasised by using a combination of two motifs popular in Palladianism, the Palladian window and the Gibbsian surround.  The carved tympanum in place of a fanlight is a notable and unusual feature, and features the coat of arms of the original owner of the house, Samuel Achmuty (high sheriff of Longford in 1720/21), and the inscription reads ‘Dum Spiro Spero’, the Achmuty (or Auchmuty) family motto.  There was formerly a niche above the doorcase, flanked to either side by window openings.  Craig (1976) describes this building as standing Janus-like between the seventeenth-century (now thought to date from the early eighteenth-century) Dutch-inspired Beaulieu (County Louth NIAH 13902509) and the eighteenth-century Palladian classicism then becoming current through the influence of James Gibbs and William Kent.  The present house replaced an earlier residence (associated with the Achmuty family at Brianstown (possibly built c. 1640 or 1654? - grant of fee farm at Brianstown from the Forbes family of Castle Forbes).  The Achmuty family (from Fifeshire, Scotland) originally came to Ireland during the early seventeenth-century (c. 1625), and a Capt. A(u)chmuty was later involved in the defence of Castle Forbes during the war of 1641.  The Achmuty family were an important family with a number of notable military connections (indeed the family were originally granted lands in Ireland as reward for military service); including Thomas Achmuty (d. 1766), a captain of the 27th Foot Regiment; Samuel Achmuty, a lieutenant-colonel in the Longford militia during the late-eighteenth and high sheriff of the county in 1789; and Samuel-Benjamin, an assistant-adjunct-general to a division in the British Army during the Peninsular Wars (1808 - 1814).  The house was the residence of a Thomas Gordon Auchmuty, Esq., in 1837 (Lewis); a Capt. Henry Musters in 1846 (Slater’s Directory), a H. Aughmuty Musters in 1881 (Slater’s Directory), and a John G.

This fine and well-detailed moulded cut stone moulded doorcase creates a central focus to the main elevation and adds artistic appeal to the otherwise blank façade.  The central chimneystack is aligned parallel to the roof ridge, which is an unusual feature that gives this building an interesting roofline and a strong silhouette.

Long approach avenue to the east of house.","Although altered with the loss of some original fabric, this interesting house retains much of its early character.  The long narrow appearance of this house, with the stocky chimneystacks and the pitched roof would appear to indicate an early date for the structure.  While a house was indeed built on this site in the 1700s (local information), the structure as it appears today is said to be a latter addition to an earlier portion (south end; map information) which was demolished in the early twentieth-century.  The large window openings to the front are consistent with a nineteenth-century provenance, but perhaps more telling is the lack of any openings to the rear, an unusual feature that suggests that this building formerly had a return to the rear or that it may be of considerable antiquity.  Like many large houses in Ireland, the entrance is emphasised, in this case with a fine carved stone surround and a round-headed opening, which adds a decorative element to the otherwise plan front elevation.  The proportions to the front elevation, and the location of the chimneystacks, indicates that this building was extended to the south by a bay at some stage.  The two-storey outbuilding to the rear and the attractive entrance gateway and pedestrian turnstile to the northwest of the house add considerably to this interesting composition.  The rubble stone wall to the rear with loop hole openings is probably part of a partially demolished outbuilding, perhaps associated with a walled garden.  Middleton was reputedly bought by the Montfort family in 1764, and was the residence of a Montford Esq. c. 1777 - 83 (Taylor and Skinner map).  It was still in the possession of the Montford  (Henry Esq.) in 1846 (Slater’s Directory).  The Montford (or de Montfort family) were of French Huguenot descent, and appear to have come to have originally come to Ireland during the late-seventeenth century, probably just after 1690 (a Pierre de Montford was a lieutenant in the army of William III; he settled in County Longford in 1702).

Main entrance gates to the south of the chapel comprising a pair of rendered gate piers (on square-plan) having modern metal double leaf gates.","This simple early nineteenth century hall/barn-type chapel, prominently sited on a main road, presents a pleasing façade along the main approach road into Longford Town from the east.  The relatively lack of detailing, and the absence of an attached belfry, is indicative of the lack of resources available to the Roman Catholic church in Ireland at the time of construction.  The absence of a belfry may also be the result of the restrictions of the Penal Laws, prior to Emancipation in 1829, when the Roman Catholic Church was not permitted to have a bell for worship.  The simple pointed arch window openings give this simple building a muted Gothic theme and character.  The understated coherent decorative scheme culminates in the later ornate porch with decorative brackets to the double doors, which unifies and emphasises the subdued Gothic theme of the building.  The gable ends are adorned with delicate wrought-iron finials, which add artistic interest.
The fine figurative stained glass windows to the chancel gable add a further decorative element the interior.  These ornate windows were probably added c. 1900 and may be by Mayer of Munich, a prolific firm whose work can be found in many Roman Catholic churches and chapels throughout Ireland.  This church was probably originally built as a chapel of ease within the Templemichael Parish.",1820,1835,Regional,church/chapel,217148,274197,617095,774216,53.71733445,-7.741007433,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401405_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401405,SURV018

Single-storey ancillary structures to site having rubble stone walls and pitched natural slate and corrugated-metal roofs.  Former millrace runs southeast-northwest to the west side of the main mill building.  Former mill pond to the east, now dry.  Located to the north of Killashee.","Although now derelict, this simple and functional former corn mill complex retains its early form and character.  The relatively small-scale of this mill suggests that it was more of a vernacular/toll milling complex than a large scale merchant milling complex, which tend to have much larger and taller mill buildings (such as is found at Clynan and Shrule for example).  This corn mill would have provided a basic service to local farmers in grinding and milling their corn, and was also an important source of employment for the local community.  It probably dates to the late-eighteenth or the early-nineteenth-century, a period that saw a great boom in the Irish corn milling industry.  Of particular interest is the survival of the composite water wheel )c. 12 feet in diameter), which provides an interesting insight into historic industrial processes.  This water wheel was apparently formerly an overshot wheel (Industrial heritage report 1976), but little evidence of the elevated millrace now survives.  Machinery was also in-situ in 1976.  It was in the ownership of a Patrick Blackman c. 1850 (Griffith’s Valuation), consisted of a house, office, mill and land (25 acres) and had a ratable value of £25 at this time.

The house is enhanced by the retention of notable features and materials such as the timber sash windows with some interior shutters remaining, natural slate roof and tooled limestone sills.  The raised cut stone verges and the eaves courses lend it an imposing appearance.  The regular façade is enhanced by the ornate doorway with carved limestone rusticated surround, which enhances the front elevation and provides a central focus.  The location of the chimneystacks and the fenestration pattern to the rear elevation suggests that this building may have been altered/extended on at least one occasion.  Its location in close proximity to Carriglass Manor (13401414) hints that it may have formerly had some connection with this estate, possibly as a dower house etc.  The complex of outbuildings arranged around a courtyard to the rear (southeast) add considerably to the setting and context of this interesting composition, which is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.

The gateway is attributed to the renowned classical architect James Gandon (1742 – 1823), the architect responsible for the designs of a number of structures at Carrigglas (including the stables (13401415) built between 1792 and 1804, and designer of both the Custom House and the Four Courts in Dublin.  Indeed the form of this gateway is quite similar in style to those found along the screens to the front of the Four Courts (Casey and Rowan 1993) and at the Custom House.  The gateway makes a strong, formal architectural statement with its central triumphal arch surmounted by a heavy entablature having symmetrical, flanking walls.  The decoration is secondary to the architecture of the structure, but is nonetheless refined and skillfully executed.  The gateway retains its ornate double leaf wrought- and cast-iron gates and flanking single leaf gates, which are a fine examples of the quality of metal work being produced at the time.  This gateway was built at the expense of Sir William Gleadowe-Newcomen, the owner of the Carrigglas Manor at the time of construction.  He later went bankrupt, following the collapse of the Newcomen Bank, and before work could start on a neoclassical villa that Gleadowe-Newcomen commissioned Gandon to design.  Carrigglas Manor was leased to, and later bought, by Thomas Lefroy, a distinguished lawyer, in the early-nineteenth century, and it was Lefroy who built the present Carrigglas Manor (13401414) from c. 1837.

This south-facing building is ideally located to provide shelter, whilst taking full advantage of natural light etc, and it has commanding views over the estate to the south.  The slate roof and the presence of a fireplace to the interior indicates that it had a function rather than acting as primarily a ‘eye-catcher’ or romantic ruin, features that are sometimes found on large country estates in Ireland (Belvedere, County Westmeath, for example).  The architectural style of the summerhouse house is in keeping with the Tudor-Gothic Revival style of the main house, designed by Daniel Robertson (died c. 1849) for The Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Thomas Langlois Lefroy, in 1837.  However, it is unlikely that Robertson was involved in its design as this structure is lacking his architectural skill.

Low ashlar limestone wall to the rear (southeast) of house having gateway comprising a pair of ashlar limestone gate piers (on octagonal-plan) having moulded limestone caps and wrought-iron double gates.","This rambling Tudor Revival or Elizabethan house, with its dramatic roofline of Tudoresque chimneystacks, turrets and gabled projections, is one of the finest houses of its type and date in the country.  It is well-built using ashlar limestone masonry and is extensively detailed with carved and cut limestone of the highest quality (the main masonry contractor involved was William Dennin, while Andrew Coffey was responsible for the carved coats-of-arms and much of the detailing).  The principal entrance front of the main elevation (northwest) is almost symmetrical, with its central gabled bay flanked to either side by three-stage towers on octagonal-plan, but the other elevations of the main block and to the ancillary wings are irregular, which creates an interesting plan with contrasting elevations and perspectives.  Unusually for a country house of its size and date, the service wings are treated with the same architectural flair as the main house, and not hidden within a courtyard to the rear or in the basement as is more commonly encountered.  The plan of the building is deceptively simple, the main block is essentially a plain rectangle, which through the addition of soaring towers and lofty Tudor style chimneystacks, acquires an almost theatrical façade.  The Tudor Gothic theme culminates in the frivolous and playful conservatory/orangery to the rear.  This conservatory, with its arcade of pointed arches, is reminiscent of the later French Gothic style with its towering gabled buttresses, tall wide window openings and thin walls.  Carrigglas Manor is a fine example of the nineteenth century penchant for dramatic, sixteenth-century architecture given a romantic interpretation.  Carrigglas Manor was built to designs by Daniel Robertson (died 1849), for Thomas Langlois Lefroy (1776 – 1869), Baron of the Court of Exchequer in 1841 and later the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland (from 1852).  Reputedly, the character Mr. Darcy in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice was based on the Thomas Lefroy (they met in England when Lefroy was attending college there).  The architect of Carrigglas, Daniel Robertson, came to Ireland in 1829 after working on a number of Oxford colleges, buildings that are frequently built in the Tudor or Elizabethan style, which must have influenced Robertson’s Tudor-Revival designs of which he is a noted exponent.  Robertson received many commissions following his arrival in Ireland, mainly for country house work (mostly in a Tudor style) in the south eastern counties, particularly in Counties Wexford and Carlow.  Carrigglas is his only known commission in the north midlands.  The present Carrigglas Manor is built on the site (or close to the site) of an earlier house (LF014-116----).  The estate (and house?) was originally a manor of the Church of Ireland Bishops of Ardagh.  The estate was left to Trinity College, Dublin, in the seventeenth-century and was later leased by Trinity, c. 1695 (deed), to the Newcomen family (later the Gleadowe-Newcomen family).  It appears to have been bought by the Newcomen family in 1772.  The owner/resident at the turn of the nineteenth-century, Sir William Gleadowe-Newcomen, commissioned James Gandon (1742 – 1823), the architect responsible for a number of structures at Carrigglas (including the stables (13401415), to design a neoclassical villa for him at Carrigglas.  However, he later went bankrupt, following the collapse of the Newcomen Bank, before work could start on this house/villa.  The Newcomen family had lived in Longford, (at Mosstown, Keenagh, amongst other places) , from the early-seventeenth century.  Carrigglas Manor was leased to, and later bought, by the above Thomas Lefroy, c. 1833 (newspaper).  This fine house forms the centrepiece of an extensive collection of related structures at Carrigglas, which represents one of the most important demesnes in north Leinster.  The estate remained in the possession of the Lefroy family until c. 2005.",1835,1850,National,country house,216688,277487,616636,777505,53.74690558,-7.747790253,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401414_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401414,SURV018

Located with the grounds of Carrigglas Manor, to the west of the main house, and to the northwest of Longford Town centre.","These two courtyards of outbuildings associated with Carrigglas Manor (13401414) represent one of the best examples of their type in Ireland.  They were designed by James Gandon (1742 – 1823) and were constructed between c. 1792 and c. 1804.  This complex comprises an elegantly proportioned walled rectangle divided into two courtyards with a stable block to the northeast and a more architecturally plain and rustic, but nevertheless, impressive, agricultural/farmyard complex to the southwest.  The differing architectural treatment of the yards has been interpreted as a metaphor for the superior status of the horse over agricultural/farmyard activity (Craig 1982, 240).  Casey and Rowan (1993, 180) suggest that the stableyard was constructed first, c. 1792 and that the farmyard was added later.  Entrance to the yards is through arched gateways that act as a central focus to the complexes.  The arched entrance to the central range dividing the two courtyards, formerly had a cupola over, now no longer extant.  The highest quality materials have been used throughout the fabric of these structures and they survive in good condition despite being out of use for a considerable period, which is testament to the quality of the original construction.  The classical language of Gandon’s architecture is given free reign in these functional yet highly refined structures.  The entrance ranges are distinguished from the side ranges, which housed the stables, animal houses and possibly also accommodation for farm workers, by the austere pedimented breakfronts with limited ornamentation.  The relative scarcity of decoration lends a force and gravity to Gandon’s architecture that is immediately apparent when compared to the picturesque and frivolous Carrigglas Manor, an Elizabethan or Tudor-Gothic revival house, designed by a leading proponent of the style, Daniel Robertson (died c. 1849) c. 1837.  This complex was commissioned by Sir William Gleadowe-Newcomen, the owner of Carrigglas Demesne at the time of construction.  Gleadowe-Newcomen also commissioned Gandon to design a neoclassical villa for him at Carrigglas.  However, Gleadowe-Newcomen later went bankrupt, following the collapse of the Newcomen Bank, before work could start on this house/villa.  This impressive complex forms an integral element of a group of related structures associated with Carrigglas Manor (13401414), which represents one of the most important demesnes in north Leinster.",1790,1805,National,stables,216517,277536,616465,777554,53.74735079,-7.750384338,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401415_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401415,SURV018

Chapel surround on three sides by rendered boundary walls, low split concrete block wall to road-frontage to the southeast.","Although altered on a number of occasions, this simple early nineteenth-century T-plan Roman Catholic chapel retains much of its early character and form.  Its plain form is indicative of the relative lack of resources available to the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland at the time of construction, and also due to the penal restrictions in force prior to Catholic Emancipation in 1829.  The round-headed window and door openings were probably added during the mid-twentieth century, possibly in 1928 when the church was remodelled, while the interior was reordered in 1976 with the loss of early altar fittings.  The fine pictorial figurative stained glass windows flanking the chancel add a decorative element to the interior.  These windows were probably added during the late-nineteenth or early-twentieth century.  The present church was constructed when Fr. John O’Reilly, parish priest of Killoe, in 1826 (date plaque).  The belfry to the west gable must have been added after c. 1830, as bells were not allowed for worship under the Penal Laws, prior to Catholic Emancipation in 1829, suggesting that the chapel was altered c. 1830.  There was an earlier church marked with a ‘cross’ located here, or somewhere close by, on the Edgeworth map of County Longford, c. 1814.

This doorcase is finely carved and of an unusual design, not common in County Longford (although a similar doorcase is to be found on Main Street, Granard (13305026).  The heavy keystones articulate the round-headed arch , and it is clearly the work of skilled craftsmen.  The return to the rear is later, perhaps c. 1880.  This house may have been associated with a number of corn mills to site during the early-nineteenth century, which were located to the north and northeast of the house in 1838 (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map), when the area was known as ‘Milltown’.  There was formerly a mill pond just to the east of the house, now silted up.

The north range is enlivened by the decorative block-and-start surrounds to the openings which adds an element of artistic interest to this otherwise functional structure.  The buildings are enhanced by the retention of features and materials such as the tooled limestone sills, timber battened half doors and natural slate roofs.  The three timber half-doors to the north range suggests that this was partially in use as stables, while the form of the range to the south indicates that it may have been in use as two semi-detached estate worker’s houses.

The noted architect John Hargrave (1788 – 1833) is recorded as designing a ‘new house’ for Willoughby Bond of Farragh/Farraghroe sometime between c. 1811 and c. 1833, and it is probable that the earlier outbuildings here date to this period.

The piers are solidly constructed and form a strong focal point which is offset by the finely sculpted limestone side entrances.  The level of craftsmanship involved in the construction of these gates is of the highest quality, partially seen in the floral detailing to the friezes of the piers.

Main entrance gates to the south comprising a pair of ashlar limestone gate piers (on square-plan) having carved capstones and wrought-iron flat bar gates.","This distinctive building is the oldest surviving Presbyterian meeting house in continual use outside of Ulster, and is in use by the oldest Presbyterian congregation in the midlands.  It is a highly unusual structure to encounter in the Irish midlands, being of a type that is more commonly found in the north of the island (this meeting house at Corboy is similar in appearance to a meeting house at Dunmurry in Antrim for example).  It survives in good condition, retaining its early form and character.  The appealing symmetrical front elevation is enlivened by the robust block-and-start surrounds to the doorways and by the tall round-headed window openings with timber sliding sash windows.  The intersecting tracery to the heads of the windows and to the fanlights of the doorways is of late eighteenth-century appearance, and represent rare surviving examples of joinery from this period.  The steeply pitched roof gives it a very distinctive roofline.  The liturgical centre of this meeting house was originally set to the centre of the back wall, as was the case with many ‘nonconformist’ churches/meeting houses in Ireland during the eighteenth century, including early Roman Catholic churches.  The interior was reordered  c. 1880, which is possibly when the stained glass window to the east was added.  The two-storey block to the rear was apparently in use as a Presbyterian manse until the present manse (13401442), located adjacent to the southeast, was completed in 1847.  The meeting house is surrounded by a graveyard with mainly eighteenth and nineteenth-century cut stone memorials, both upstanding and recumbent, the earliest of which is to James Bond, dated 1762 (or Oliver Bond, dated 1776 – Longford Graveyard survey).  The simple boundary walls, gate piers and gates add to the setting and complete this very interesting composition, which is a unique element of the built heritage of County Longford.  The present meeting house was built in 1729 by the Revd. James Bond (who was a minister at an earlier meeting house here in 1722), who built also built a fine country house at nearby Newtownbond, c. 1731, now demolished.  The present meeting house replaced an earlier meeting house here at Corboy, which was reputedly founded in 1675 by a Rev. Jacques.  The present building may have been built following an exodus of Presbyterians to America from County Longford in 1729 to escape persecution in Ireland.

Gateway to the east side of approach avenue to house comprising a pair of cut limestone gate posts (on octagonal-plan) having pyramidal-shaped heads and a pair of wrought-iron flat bar gates.","Although now out of use, this site is notable as rare intact example of a nineteenth-century farmhouse with related outbuildings set around a courtyard to the rear.  The well-portioned house/farmhouse itself was probably built during the early-nineteenth century.  Its form is classically-inspired and is influenced by the early nineteenth century penchant for diminishing window openings, a common feature of such houses in Longford.  It represents a good example of a typical rural type, of which relatively few examples remain in such early condition as this example at Cooleeny.  The two-storey block to the rear south end of main elevation was added later, perhaps c. 1860.  The complex of outbuildings, set around a central courtyard to the rear of the house, is a noteworthy survival.  These outbuildings retain their early character and add substantially to the setting and context of the house.  They retain much of their original form and are of simple, almost vernacular design.  The red brick voussoirs to the carriage arches contrasts attractively with the grey rubble stone construction.  The roughly dressed rubble limestone lintels to the window openings to the outbuilding to the north are notable, and are a feature of the extended vernacular tradition.  The lattice work window to the north range is an interesting survival, and is of a type encountered more commonly at outbuildings associated with contemporary country houses.  The outbuilding to the east end of the south range is earlier than the other buildings (as evidenced by the break in the stonework) and may date to the construction to the main house.  The other outbuildings were built later, perhaps c. 1860 (map information).  The monolithic gate posts to the main entrance and to the field gate to the east side of the approach avenue to the house are well-carved, and are subtle examples of the skill of nineteenth century craftsmanship.  The simple wrought-iron gates are attractive examples of their type and further add to the setting.  The site also retains a number of rubble limestone boundary walls.  This building is a worthy addition to the built heritage of the local area, and represents an attractive feature in the rural landscape to the southeast of Longford Town.  This house was the residence of the Carroll family during the mid-nineteenth century, including Thomas Carroll who died in 1865 (memorial inscription).

Although of quite simple construction, these outbuildings are given a classical architectural character by the central pedimented breakfronts to both ranges.  This classical element lends these buildings a sense of grandeur and compliments the late-Georgian architecture of the main house to the southeast.  The scale of these outbuildings provides an interesting historical and social insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a country estate in Ireland during the mid-to-late nineteenth century.  The bellcote, and the roundel motif and the (helpful) date plaque to the central breakfronts adds additional interest and are modest examples of the skill of nineteenth century craftsmanship.  The timber sliding sash windows to the southwest end of the northeast range hints that this building may have been in use as estate workers accommodation, although they may be later additions.  The range to the northwest may have been built after the northeast range was constructed (hints in the stonework).  The outbuildings are of apparent architectural design and quality, and form a pair of related structures with the house itself.

The form of this house, with the shallow hipped roof with overhanging eaves and a central pair of moulded ashlar chimneystacks, and the wide elliptical-headed doorcase, suggests that this building was either rebuilt or extensively remodelled c. 1850 (possibly in 1845 – date plaque to outbuildings (13401450) to the rear).  The proportions are classically-inspired with a rigid symmetry to the front elevation.  The decoration to this main elevation is reserved for the central doorcase with its elegant wide elliptical doorway set in a plain ashlar limestone surround.  This doorway is particularly notable for its skillfully carved timber detailing, and the graceful elliptical-headed fanlight and sidelights.  There is evidence in the shading to the ashlar surround to suggest that it formerly had flanking Ionic pilasters, now removed.  The ashlar masonry surround the doorway exhibits a high degree of skill, which serves as a reminder of the quality of the craftsmanship available at the time of construction.  The flight of limestone steps lend a further air of grandeur to the building, demonstrating the strong influence of the architecture of the classical great house on the homes of the middle class.  Although this building is constructed with good quality masonry, particularly the openings, it was originally rendered.  This house forms the centrepiece of a pair of related structures along with the associated outbuildings (13401450) to the northwest and represents an important element of the built heritage of Longford, adding architectural and historic appeal to the rural countryside to the north of Ardagh.  This house was formerly associated with the Gregg family.  The Gregg family originally settled at Rathallard (now Oldtown?), Longford, in 1688, suggesting that the present house may occupy (or be close to) the site of a much earlier house (a house on narrower-plan is indicated at this site in 1838 - Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map).  A James Gregg of Oldtown was High Sheriff of Longford in 1809, and was later the residence of a Thornton Gregg in 1824 (Pigot’s Directory) and 1837 (Lewis Topographical Dictionary).  It was described as ‘the property of Mr. Gregg’ with ‘ a large garden and extensive out offices’ in 1838 (Ordnance Survey Letters) and may have been in the ownership of a Rev.

Of particular note is the three-bay two-storey former cattle/bull shed to the southwest yard, which is built to a very high architectural standard especially considering its original utilitarian function.  This building was constructed by the owner of Cartroncar House, c. 1870, a Cootey or Thomas Bond(?), reputedly for the breeding of prize bulls, and the unusually grand form of this building illustrates the importance of this activity to the then owner.  The single-storey concrete outbuilding to the southeast corner of the southwest yard was apparently built as a munitions or ammunition store c. 1900, and represents an early example of poured concrete construction in County Longford.  The attractive wrought- and cast-iron gates, and the rubble stone boundary walls add context to this building, and complete the setting.  The yard to the northeast was probably originally built c. 1832 for James Wensley Bond (1781 – 1843), the originally owner of the house, and High Sheriff of Longford in 1822.  The Bond family were important in the local area during the eighteenth and nineteenth century and had further seats at Newtownbond and at Farragh/Farraghroe (both now demolished).  Cartroncar House was the residence of a Thomas Bond in 1846 and a Thomas W. Bond in 1881 (Slater’s Directories), and later possibly a Bryan Brady in 1894 (Slater’s Directory).  This outbuilding complex forms part of an interesting group of related structures associated with Cartroncar House, along with the main house (13401503), the walled garden (13401505) to the rear (northwest), and the main entrance gates (13401506) and boundary walls to the south) and is an important element of the built heritage of the local area.",1830,1880,Regional,farmyard complex,228106,276765,628051,776783,53.73992717,-7.5747986,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401504_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401504,SURV018

Its form is typical of houses of its type and date in rural Ireland, with a three-bay two-storey main elevation, hipped natural slate roof with a pair of centralised chimneystacks, and central round-headed door opening with fanlight.  The influence of classicism can be seen in the tall ground floor window openings and the rigid symmetry to the front facade.  The simple doorcase with the delicate petal fanlight over provides a central focus and enlivens the plain front elevation.  The return to the rear has unusually thick walls and a relative dearth of openings, possibly indicating that it contains earlier fabric.  This house forms an interesting group with the entrance gates to the southeast, the outbuildings (13401509) and walled garden to the rear, and the highly ornate railings to the southwest side featuring a sinuous vine leaf motif.  The quality of these railings is such that their appearance is equally fine from both sides, the vine leaves being cast in three dimensions.  They are notable examples of their type and date, and add substantial to the setting of this fine composition, which is an important element of the built heritage of the local area.  Moorhill was the home of a R. (Robert or Richard) Blackall, Esq. in 1837 (Lewis).  The Blackalls were an important family in the locality and built nearby Coolamber Manor (13401520) c. 1837.  It was possibly the home of Robert Blackall, the father of Samuel Wensley, who was responsible for the construction of Coolamber Manor and later served as M.P. (1847 - 51) for the county before serving as Governor of Queensland, Australia from 1868 until his death in 1871.

It retains much of its salient fabric, including early timber sliding sash windows to the rear and a doorway with sidelights and spoked fanlight to the centre of the front elevation.  The influence of classicism can be seen in the tall ground floor window openings and the rigid symmetry to the front facade.  The simple doorcase with side lights and spoked fanlight over provides a central focus and enlivens the plain front elevation.  The replacement timber casement windows to the front elevation fail to detract substantially from the aspect of this building.  The narrow plan and the chimneystacks to either gable end suggest that this building is of considerable antiquity, perhaps late-eighteenth century or, perhaps, earlier.  Sensitively restored, this building would be an important element of the built heritage of Longford.  It occupies is close to the site of an earlier castle (LF015-021---), which is adjacent to the southeast, and attests to a long-standing presence and importance of this site.  There was an earlier house here from at least the early eighteenth century  associated with Nugent family, hence the name of the site.  A deed dated 1703 mentions a James Nugent of Castle Nugent, Esq., and there are later references to the Nugent family of Castlenugent throughout the eighteenth century.  The Nugent family at Castle Nugent are probably a subsidiary branch of the Nugent family of Killasonna House (13401602) to the east, or perhaps they moved from Castle Nugent to Killasonna sometime during the second half of the eighteenth century.

The piers are well-built using good quality ashlar limestone masonry, while the attractive elaborate cast-iron gates add artistic merit and are good examples of their type and date.  The style of the gates suggests that this gateway was erected during the mid-to-late nineteenth century, replacing an earlier gateway at the same site (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838).  The style of the gates here are quite similar to those serving Ardagh House, which were erected c. 1863.  Firmount House has important historical connections with the Edgeworth family, and was the home (and possibly the birthplace) of the celebrated L'Abbe Edgeworth De Firmont (1745 – 1807), who was vicar-general of the Diocese of Paris at the height of the French Revolution.  There are references to the Edgeworth family of Firmount as least as far back as 1736, when a ‘Revd. Mr Essex Edgeworth of Firmount’ built or rebuilt a chapel that was located just to the south of the gates but now demolished (demolished c. 1860, and possibly at the same time the present gates were erected).  Firmount was the home of a Rd. Mr Brooke c. 1780 (Taylor and Skinner map 1777 – 83), probably Rev. William Brooke.  The gateway appears to have later served/also served Lissard House to the southwest.  Lissard was a three-storey house of late eighteenth-century date (incorporating an earlier block c. 1700) that was associated with O’Ferrall/More O’Ferrall family throughout the nineteenth century.

The contrast between the roughly dressed grey limestone masonry and the smooth red brick dressings to the openings creates an appealing tonal and textured appearance.  The quality of the design and execution of this house, together with it's modest size, suggests that it may have been originally constructed as a worker's house, perhaps associated with the complex of  nearby quarries (rear; south and east) which were active in the nineteenth and early twentieth century (Ordnance Survey six-inch map sheets 1838 and 1913).  Its symmetrical front elevation and refinements such as timber bargeboards to the projecting centre bay and terracotta ridge cresting give this structure hint at mannered rather than vernacular origins.  The incised initials (J. N. ?)to one of the side elevations probably records the original builder or occupier.

It is built in a late-Georgian/Regency classical idiom, and retains its early form, character and the majority of its early fabric despite the construction of a number of modern extensions to the rear.  The Giant order pilasters between the bays of the two main facades, along with the very prominent eaves cornice and blocking course, lend this building a distinctive appearance that is reminiscent of a contemporary seaside villa that could be found in Dun Laoghaire, Monkstown etc.  These giant pilasters add interest to the main façade, created a stepped profile that gives this facade a robust but surprising delicate architectural character.  The full-height three-bay bow to the east elevation is another interesting architectural element that helps to add further visual impact when approaching the building along the main avenue, and creates an imposing and handsome silhouette in the landscape.  The plan of this house is quite unusual with the stair hall to one side of the building (west), which is lit by an enormous round-headed window opening with tripartite timber sash windows.  The house also retains many notable features and materials that enhance the building, including timber sash windows and cut limestone steps with ornate cast-iron railings to the entrance.  This house was built to designs by the eminent architect John Hargrave (c. 1788 – 1833).  Hargrave worked extensively in County Longford during the 1820s and was responsible for the designs for the governor’s house at Longford Town Jail in 1824 (13001036); works at Ardagh House in 1826 (13312039); the rebuilding of St. Paul’s Church of Ireland church at Newtown-Forbes (13303021); the remodelling of Castle Forbes (13303001), nearby Farragh/Farraghroe House (demolished); Doory Hall (13314005) now ruinous; St. Paul’s Church of Ireland church, Ballinalee (13304009); and possibly for the designs of St. Catherine’s Church of Ireland church (13400914) at nearby Killoe.  This house was built for Major Samuel Wesley Blackhall (1809 – 1871), and may have replaced an earlier house associated with the Blackall family at Coolamber (a Robert Blackall (1764 – 1855), father of the above, lived in Longford in the late-eighteenth century).  Major S. W. Blackall had a distinguished career, serving as High Sheriff of Longford in 1833 and later as MP for Longford between 1847 – 51.  He served abroad after 1851, acting as Lieutenant-Governor of Dominca between 1851 – 57, Governor of Sierra Leone between 1862 – 65, and as Governor of Queensland, Australia, from 1868 until his death in 1871.  Coolamber Manor was the home of a Major Robert Blackall in 1846 (Slater’s Directory), High Sheriff of Longford in 1859 – 61.  It was later the home of the Stanley family (Burroughs Stanley in 1894) and then the Wingfield family.  It was sold c. 1960 and was in use as a rehabilitation centre until recently.  Coolamber Manor is an important element of the built heritage of County Longford and forms the centrepiece of a group of related structures along with the complex of outbuildings (13401521) and the walled garden and ancillary structures to the west.",1825,1835,Regional,country house,232268,274192,632212,774210,53.71656792,-7.512004181,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401520_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401520,SURV018

These buildings largely retain their early form and character, despite some alterations to accommodate new uses during the late-twentieth century.  The stables comprise an elegantly proportioned walled rectangle divided into two courtyards.  The scale of this complex provides an interesting historical insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a large country estate in Ireland during the nineteenth century.  High quality materials have been used in the construction of these outbuildings including fines dressed limestone detailing to the pediments, the bellcote and to many of the openings, and ornate cast-iron gates.  The east complex is distinguished from the west outbuildings by the pedimented central bays decorated having dressed limestone roundel openings.  These pedimented bays lends the west complex a muted classical architectural character that compliments the style of the main house to the east.  The pediment to the north range, west complex, is particularly notable as it doubles as a dovecote and makes for an interesting and unusual feature.

The front elevation (southeast) is enlivened by the well-executed, if unusual, cut stone doorcase, which provides a central focus and adds artistic interest to main elevation.  The cut decorative petal fanlight to the doorcase adds further additional interest.  The cut limestone quoins to the corners and the central pair of ashlar limestone chimneystacks emphasise the formal qualities of this building.  The margin timber sliding sash windows are a later addition, but do not detract substantially from the architectural expression of this building.  The complex of outbuildings to the rear, and the good quality entrance gate to the south add considerably to the setting and complete this composition.  The gateway to the south may have been moved from another location and rebuilt in this present location.  This building has a long approach avenue to the south and formerly had a gate lodge to at the entrance close to the village of Lanesborough, now no longer extant.  Cloonbony House was the residence of a Capt. Davis, Longford Yeomanry, in 1824 (Pigot’s Directory), a George Davys, Esq., in 1881 (Slater’s Directory) and a James Davys, J. P., in 1894.  The Davys family, of Scottish origin, settled somewhere around the Lanesborough area during the mid-seventeenth century.  There are references to a Davys at Cloonbony from the early-eighteenth century (death record – of a Richard Davys of Cloonbunaghy died 1724/5 and buried at Lanesborough; later marriage record 1731 - 2), which suggests the presence of an earlier house on or near this site. There is a Clonbonny House, the residence of a Davies, Esq., marked here on a Taylor and Skinner map dated 1777 - 1783.  The present house may have been built in 1802 as there reference to a William Davys who ‘began the new house in Cloonbonny, and that the walls were built in July’ (Davys Family Records, internet).  The house was still in the ownership of the Davys family in 1907.

To the northwest of Rathcline Castle (not in survey).","This impressive and well-crafted ashlar limestone obelisk-type monument is an interesting addition to the landscape to the southwest of Lanesborough.  This elegant monument was erected by Colonel Henry White, in memory of his young son George (aged 14), who died tragically when a gun accidentally discharged while hunting duck on Lough Ree (in 1846).  Henry White (1789 - 1873) was probably resident at nearby Rathcline House (13401704), to the southeast, at the time of the accident.  Henry White, 1st Baron Annaly from 1863, was an important individual who served as M.

13401704,Rathcline House,,,,,RATHCLINE,Longford,LF,LF,"Detached four-bay two-storey over-basement house on T-shaped plan, built c. 1820, having projecting end bay to the west end of the front elevation (north), with canted single-storey bay window to front, and two-storey over basement return to the rear (south) at the west corner.  Single-bay two-storey block to rear at re-entrant corner of return and single-storey over basement flat-roofed return (c. 1956) to south end of rear return.  Possibly originally built as a hunting/fishing lodge.  Later in use as a convent (Sisters of Mercy), c. 1956 to c. 1970, and now in use as a private house.  Hipped natural slate roof with overhanging eaves and having two rendered chimneystacks with diagonal tops/chimney pots with cut stone coping.  Sprocketed, hipped copper roof to canted bay window.  Painted roughcast rendered walls with cut limestone string course between basement and ground floors.  Square-headed window openings with replacement windows and having limestone label mouldings over and tooled limestone sills.  Square-headed door opening adjacent to advanced end bay having glazed timber double doors with overlight.  Flight of limestone steps to entrance flanked by cast-iron railings set on cut limestone plinth walls.  Set back from road in extensive grounds to the south of Lanesborough, close to the northwest shores of Lough Ree.  House located on an elevated site.  Multiple-bay two–storey outbuilding to the rear having pitched corrugated-metal roof, cast-iron rainwater goods and projecting eaves course.  Painted roughcast rendered walls.  Square-headed window openings with painted limestone sills, some with two-over-two timber sliding sash windows.  Square-headed door openings, some with timber battened doors and half-doors.  Square-headed carriage arch to the east end of the main elevation (north) having timber battened double doors.

Round-headed wrought-iron arch over gateway, linking piers, having wrought-iron detailing and a wrought-iron cross finial to head.  Rubble stone boundary walls on quadrant plan to either side of gateway (east and west), rubble stone boundary wall to road-frontage.","This substantial house retains much of its early form and character.  The loss of the early fittings to the openings fails to detract substantially from its appearance.  The plain front elevation is enlivened by the finely dressed cut stone detailing including the limestone label mouldings over the openings and by the wide string course above the basement level.  The projecting end bay adds interest to the façade and breaks up the regularity of the elevation.  The irregular-plan, the label mouldings over the openings, and the diagonally-set chimneystacks lend this building a muted Tudor Revival architectural character.  The form of this building suggests that it dates to the late-nineteenth century.  However, there is a building on this site on the same footprint and plan on an 1838 map of the area (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map).  This suggests that the house may have been rebuilt or remodelled during the late-nineteenth century.  The substantial, if plain, outbuilding to the rear retains much of its early character and fabric, and adds context to the main house.  The main gateway to the north of the house is well-crafted in good quality ashlar stone work, and retains decorative cast-iron gates.  It is notable for the unusual wrought-iron arch with cross finial over, which may be a later addition c. 1956, when the house was used as a residence by the Sisters of Mercy (see below).  Set atop a steep incline, this house forms a striking silhouette in the landscape, and is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.  The rubble stone boundary walls, and the gates to site add to the setting and complete this composition, which is an integral element of the built heritage of the Lanesborough area.  There is a house indicated at Rathcline, called Rathcloine, on a map of the area date 1777 - 83 (Taylor and Skinner).  Rathcline House was in the ownership of Luke White in 1824 and in 1837 (Pigot’s Directory).  The Whites were an important family and a number of members served as M. P.s, Lord Lieutenants and High Sheriffs of County Longford (and as M. Ps and Lord Lieutenants for County Dublin) during the first half of the nineteenth century.  They were later granted the title Baron Annaly in 1863.  The White family also owned Luttrellstown Castle, near Clonsilla (County Dublin), which Luke White bought from the Luttrell family c. 1800.  This suggests that Rathcline House may have been built as a hunting lodge.  It was later the home of a St. George Johnston (rented from White family), who rented 1,139 acres in Longford during the 1870s.  It was described as both the home of St. George Johnston and as a vacant property in the ownership of Lord Annaly in 1894 (Slater’s Directory).  Rathcline House was later used to accommodate Sister of Mercy nuns (1956 to c. 1970) who ran a school at nearby Lanesborough.  The flat-roofed extension to the rear has a stained glass window of ecclesiastically character to one of the openings, perhaps indicating that it was built c. 1956 for use as a chapel by the nuns then resident there.",1810,1830,Regional,house,200174,266530,600125,766550,53.64872514,-7.998115988,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401704_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401704,SURV018

Many of these grave markers are finely carved in good quality stone and are of high artistic merit, including a number of obelisk and High Cross-type memorials.  The graveyard retains grave markers dating from the mid-seventeenth century to the present day, providing an interesting insight into the stylistic development of grave markers over a considerable period of time.  The earliest legible grave marker is dated, 1650 (R.F and V.F.), and there are a number of late-seventeenth century and early-eighteenth century grave markers to site (including to the interior of church, one to Anna Forbes dated 1696 - LF017-013005-).  The graveyard has a ruinous late-medieval or post medieval church as its centrepiece (LF017-013001-), containing the fabric of an earlier church.  This church was described as 'ruinous' c. 1830 (O'Donovan letters) but may have been in use in the eighteenth century.  Lewis (1837) described the church as follows: 'Near the ruins of the castle are those of the ancient church, said to have been destroyed from the opposite bank of the Shannon; part of the steeple is yet standing, and the cemetery is still used by the Roman Catholics'.  The surrounding boundary is very thick in places, and may be of considerable antiquity, perhaps dating from the late-medieval period.

Main entrance gates to the north comprising a pair of decorative cast-iron gate posts with pyramidal heads and cast-iron double-gates.  Rubble stone boundary walls to road-frontage to the north.","This well-proportioned former Church of Ireland rectory retains its early form, character and fabric.  This building is an example of the language of classical architecture stripped to its barest fundamental elements, which creates a fine dwelling in a subtle style.  The three-bay two-storey form is typical of Church of Ireland rectory buildings (particularly built by the Board of First Fruits), and many middle class gentleman’s residences, dating from the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century.  However, this building dates to the mid-to-late nineteenth century (Ordnance Survey six-inch sheets 1838 and 1913), and it is unusual to find a mid-to-late nineteenth-century rectory in rural Ireland.  The form of the doorway, having recessed panels to either side, suggests that there may have been flanking columns to the doorcase, now removed.  It is of social interest to the local area on account of its original intended function as a Church of Ireland rectory.  The highly decorative cast-iron gate posts and gates to the north have an ecclesiastical character, and exhibit ornate detailing and fine craftsmanship.  This building was probably built to designs by Joseph Welland (1798 – 1860), the architect for the Ecclesiastical Commissioners during the mid-nineteenth century (from 1843 onwards) or, possibly, by William John Welland (1832 – 1995) and William Gillespie, architects to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners following the death of Joseph Welland in 1860.  It may have been constructed at the same time as the Church of Ireland church at Lanesborough, St. Johns (13310007), which was built or rebuilt to designs by Joseph Welland between 1858 and 1862.  Rathcline Rectory was the residence of a Rev. Thomas Ireland (rector at Lanesborough) in 1881 (Slater’s Directory), and possibly a Rev. William Pollard in 1894 (Slater’s Directory).

It is robustly built and survives in good condition despite some recent alterations.  Its form suggests that it was originally a two classroom school, with a single class room to each floor.  However, it may have originally had a teacher’s residence to one of the floors.  The two-storey form of this school with external staircase giving access to first floor level is unusual in rural County Longford (there is a similar two-storey school at Edgeworthstown -13309013), the majority being two classroom single-storey buildings.  It is of social importance to the Lanesborough as one of the earliest school buildings still extant in the locality.  It was reputedly built between 1836 – 38, and it was one of many rural schools built throughout rural Ireland following the establishment of the Board of Education in 1831.  A report by the Superintendent for Schools at the Board of Education described the school in 1840 as ‘it is two stories in height, strongly and elegantly built, the ground floor flagged with stones’ (Board of Education report).  The costs, construction, and the site were donated by Luke White, of Rathcline House (13401704) a short distance to the south, and of Luttrellstown Castle, County Dublin.  The White family also paid most of the wages of the teacher(s) throughout the second half of the nineteenth century.  A school roll from 1841 states that there were 318 children attending this school at this time, 182 boys and 136 girls.  School rolls from immediately after the Great Famine (1845 – c. 1849) show less than half the 1841 numbers attending this school.  The classes appear to have been mixed, rather than having separate classrooms for boys and girls as was usually the case in Ireland at the time.  The school appears to have closed around 1897 after a rather fractious history that saw it closed on a number of occasions due to disagreements between the White family and the local Roman Catholic clergy.  It was later in use as a dwelling in the ownership of the McKenna family (husband and wife), who were both formerly teachers at the school.  The building was reputedly used for old IRA meetings c. 1919 (local information).  It was later in use as a dance hall during the mid-twentieth century, as a technical school from 1939 – 1946, and as a sports hall and boxing club from c. 1950.

This building also retains much of its early fabric including timber Y-tracery windows.  The pointed arch openings lend this building a muted Gothic theme.  The form of this church conforms to typical Board of First Fruits (1711 - 1833) two/three-bay hall and tower form that can be found in great numbers throughout the Irish countryside.  It is well-built using high quality dressed limestone masonry that is almost ashlar in quality (and of a higher quality than more commonly encountered with Board of First Fruit churches in Ireland) and has extensive cut stone detailing throughout, particularly to the openings and to the pinnacles and parapet to the tower.  The stout construction of this church and the stocky tower creates a striking silhouette and a strong presence in the rural landscape to the east of Killashee.  Lewis (1837) records ‘the church, a neat building with a square tower, situated nearly in the centre of the parish, was erected in 1826, by a gift of £900 from the late Board of First Fruits’.  Two stained glass windows, each depicting an angel in a medallion, were added to the nave elevations in 1915, to designs by Ethel Rhind (1878 – 1952).  The church is surrounded by graveyard, which contains an interesting collection of upstanding and recumbent gravestones, some of which are finely carved and of artistic merit.  A number of grave plots are set in railed enclosures, adding additional interest.  The earliest legible grave marker is to Thomas Verner Richardson, dated 1855.  Rev. Francis Gregg was the rector here in 1846, a Rev. John Irwin in 1881, and a Rev. Thomas Reilly in 1894 (Slater’s Directories).

Rendered walls to either side of main gateway.","Although now out of use, this substantial and well-proportioned house retains its early form and character.  It also retains much of its early fabric including Wyatt style timber sliding sash windows.  The tripartite Wyatt windows, the proportions to the front elevation and the shallow hipped roof to the main block lend this building a Regency period appearance, and suggests that it dates to the first decades of the nineteenth century.  The main doorway formerly had a pedimented Ionic doorcase, the shadow of which can be seen surrounding the doorway.  The complex form of this house to the rear suggests that it might contain earlier fabric, and that a new block was added to the front, c. 1820.  It was enlarged c. 1865 (Ordnance Survey map information, and genealogical information: see below), and the outbuildings date to this period.  The attractive and well-carved sandstone gates posts, and the simple wrought-iron gates, to the main gateway to the north form a suitably impressive entrance to this site.  The modestly detailed outbuildings to the rear complete the setting of this composition, which is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.  The location of this building adjacent to St. Catherine’s Church of Ireland church (13401802) hints that it may have been originally built as a rectory.  However, it is not indicated as a rectory on any maps of the area.  There are references to a Rev. Francis Gregg, rector of Ballymacormick from 1842 - 1867, who lived at ‘the parsonage, close by the church of Ballymacormick’, so it is very possibly that this was originally built as a rectory.  The Rev. Gregg (also of Oldtown House (13401451), near Ardagh) later moved to the rectory at Keenagh in 1867.  The house was later renamed ‘Danesfort’ and was in the ownership of a Randal(l) Adams (1825 – 1913) during the late-nineteenth century (Slater’s Directories).  Randal Adams previously lived at Rhynmount House (now demolished), to the south of Cloondara, until 1864.  In 1864 Adams advertised an auction of the furniture of Rhynmount House as he was moving to a new residence (Longford Journal).  This would roughly tie in with the dates of the move of Rev. Gregg (possibly) from this house.  It is possible that the house was remodelled and the outbuildings built, c. 1865, just in advance of the move of Randal Adams.  Adams was a important figure in the local area and served as a Grand Juror for Longford in the 1870s.  He owned acres in the area, c. 1875, and is buried next door at St. Catherine’s Church (grave marker).  Danesfort was later in the ownership of the Daly family c. 1915 (a Mrs Daly of Danesfort, Longford sold a number of household pets the proceeds of which she gave to the Prince of Wales Fund in aid of the soldiers’ and sailors’ families who were engaged in the war (World War 1).",1810,1840,Regional,house,211822,270996,611770,771015,53.68872333,-7.821803333,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401803_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401803,SURV018

The small-scale of this complex indicates that it was a vernacular corn mill, rather than a large-scale merchant corn mill as is found at Shrule and Clynan, for example.  The corn mill provided a basic service to local farmers in grinding and milling their corn (and possibly oats), and was also an important source of employment for the local community.  This complex probably dates to the late-eighteenth or the early-nineteenth century, a period that saw a great boom in the Irish corn milling industry.  Of particular significance is the rare survival of much of the early machinery and equipment to the interior of both the corn mill and to the associated corn drying kiln to the northeast.  This complex contains machinery for driving three sets of mill stones and a drying kiln where the corn was laid onto clay tiles, above a heating apparatus, and dried out.  The internal undershot water wheel also survives in remarkable condition, and this formerly ran a spur drive in addition to the main drive to power the internal machinery.  The survival of the original fittings provides an interesting historical insight into early technical and industrial processes, and represents one of the most important survivals of its type in the midlands.  The corn mill building was extended (evidence in stonework) to the west at some stage (probably during the mid-to-late nineteenth century) with the water wheel formerly set against the exterior to the west gable end of the structure.  The corn kiln to the northeast was probably added during the second half of the nineteenth century (map information), and replaced a number of small corn drying kilns to the south of the corn mill (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838).  There was formerly a mill pond to the south, now silted-up.  This mill was in the ownership of Edward T(r)elford c. 1854 (Griffith’s Valuation).  The complex consisted of a ‘house, offices, corn mill and land (including a turf bog)’ at this time, and had a ratable value of £44.  It was in the ownership of an Edward Telford, miller, in 1894 (Slater's Directory), and probably later in the ownership of the Lynam family, as the mill is known locally as ‘Lynam’s Mill’.  The last miller was a Mike Mangan of Clonsilla, Killashee, and the mill closed in the early 1950s after his death.  The remaining structures on this site, and particularly the survival of a large amount of the early machinery, represent an important part of the social, technical and architectural heritage of the Killashee area.",1780,1860,Regional,mill (water),206809,269290,606758,769309,53.67347748,-7.897718788,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401810_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401810,SURV018

It was probably originally built as a T-plan chapel with the chancel added sometime later, perhaps at the end of the nineteenth century.  The pointed arch window openings lend it the a muted Gothic architectural character.  Its simple unadorned form is indicative of the relative lack of resources available to the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland at the time of construction.  The well-executed quality ashlar limestone bellcote over the nave/entrance gable helps give this building a strong presence in the roadscape to the centre of Moydow village.  The stained glass windows lighting the chancel, which are of late nineteenth/early twentieth century appearance, and the modern stained glass window to the entrance gable help add a decorative element to this otherwise plain building.  The interior was reordered c. 1970, and the attractive modern stained glass fittings to the entrance gable (southeast) were probably added at this time.  The present church replaced an earlier Roman Catholic church at Moydow, which was located adjacent to the north (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map sheet 1838).

Approached by a long curving driveway, a sense of grandeur is expressed in the symmetrical projecting end bays to the front façade and full-height canted end bays to rear.  This impression is further enhanced by the finely executed limestone doorcase, which provides a central focus to the main elevation and adds artistic appeal.  It is unusually large for a Church of Ireland rectory, and the projecting end bays to the front elevation suggests that it is of considerable antiquity, perhaps dating to the early-to-mid eighteenth century.  However, Lewis (1837) records that ‘the glebe-house was built in 1830, at an expense of £840 Irish, of which £600 was a loan, and £200 a gift, from the late Board of First Fruits’.  However, it is not entirely clear if Lewis is referring the rectory here or one at Taghshinny to the southwest (13402330), and that this rectory was in existence in 1824 (see below).  The form of the rectory at Moydow suggests it is earlier.  The wing/block to the west is an interesting feature, and its form suggests that it may be an earlier building to site that was later extended/incorporated into the main body of the present structure.  The grounds surrounding the house are impressive, while the simple but well-crafted gateway to the east completes the setting of this notable composition.  This site formerly had a walled garden to the east of the house, now no longer extant.  This building forms a pair of related structures with the associated Church of Ireland church (13401902) to the south, which was originally built in the mid-eighteenth century on the site of an earlier seventeenth century church but is now out of use (last service in 1987).  It is possible that this rectory original dates to the (re)construction date of the earlier church, c. 1765.  This building is an important element of the built heritage of County Longford, and adds historic appeal to its pleasant rural location.  This was the home of a Rev. W. D. Armstrong in 1824 (Pigot’s Directory), a Rev. William Armstrong in 1846 (Slater’s Directory) and possibly the home of a Very Rev. Alexander Orme, Dean of Ardagh, in 1894 (Slater’s Directory), who had married the daughter of the Rev. Armstrong in 1866.  Very Rev. Orme died in 1896 and is buried at Moydow churchyard (13401902) to the south (where he is described as ‘rector of Moydow’).

It also retains many attractive features and materials including an ashlar limestone bellcote, and timber tracery and leaded glass to the window openings.  This simple church originally dates to the mid-eighteenth century and was built on the site of an earlier church (LF019-030----) that was in existence in the mid-seventeenth century (see below).  The church was repaired c. 1825 (Irish Parliamentary Returns 1837), and later rebuilt in 1831 (using a loan of £50 from Board of First Fruits), apparently following a fire.  Lewis (1837) records the 'church is a small plain building without a tower, erected about 80 years since, and was repaired in 1831, by aid of a loan of £50 from the same Board’ (Board of First Fruits 1711 - 1833).  The sacristy extension to the northeast end of the church was added c. 1860 (Ordnance Survey six-inch maps 1838 and 1914) and there was formerly a projecting wing/porch/transept to the centre of the north side of the nave (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch sheet 1838).  Thomas Jessop of nearby Mount Jessop (since demolished, outbuildings remain – 13401807) donated a bell (value £10.12.0), to Moydow Church c. 1800, and is buried in the churchyard (died 1825) in the Jessop family plot.  The graveyard retains a fine collection of recumbent, upstanding, table and box-type memorials, some of high artistic merit.  The earliest legible grave marker is dated 1640 and commemorates Morgan and Rose (O') Ferrall (LF019-030002-), while another commemorates Francis (O') Ferrall and is dated 1681 (LF019-030003-).  A fragment of a late medieval window sill was also reused as a grave marker to site.  The graveyard also contains the grave markers of a number of clergymen who resided at the nearby Moydow Church of Ireland rectory (13401901) to the north, as well as gravemakers of Roman Catholic and Methodist families.  Recessed from the road behind good quality gates piers and a simple rubble stone boundary wall, this church and its graveyard, together with a large impressive former rectory to the northeast, form an interesting group of Church of Ireland structures set on a pleasantly matured landscaped site.",1830,1835,Regional,church/chapel,214790,268736,614738,768755,53.66833692,-7.776978912,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13401902_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13401902,SURV018

The well-crafted ashlar limestone piers are indicative of the skill of nineteenth century craftsmanship, while the cast-iron gates are good example of their type.  The gateway is positioned at an angle to the road and this arrangement may have been employed to give the entranceway the appearance of closing the vista from the southeast.  A gate lodge was situated to the northwest side of the gates, now demolished (Ordnance Survey six-inch maps 1838 and 1913).  This gateway was formerly the main entrance to Richfort House, an estate that dates from the early-eighteenth century at the latest (the Charles Newcomen may have owned Cooleeshil or Richfort in 1732 – mortgage mentioned in his will), and it may have been leased or bought by the Richardson or Auchmuty Richardson family shortly after this (wills and deeds).  It was the residence (probably leased from the Richardson family) of a John Huggins, Esq., in 1824 (Pigot’s Directory) and of a James Auchmuty Richardson, Justice of the Peace (and Grand Juror of Longford), c. 1835 (O’Donovan Letters; Lewis).  Richardson also owned Richmount Hill (13402304) to the south of Ardagh c. 1840.  It may have been sold in 1868 after the sale of the house was ordered by Landed Estates Court (possibly to pay debts of J. A Richardson who died in 1862).  It was later the residence of a W.

Its front elevation is enlivened by the simple cut stone doorcase, which retains a mid-to-late nineteenth century timber panelled door.  The layout of the asymmetrical façade suggests that this structure was formerly a more modest four-bay farmhouse, later extended by two bays to the east end.  The narrow plan of this building, and the T-shaped from on early map (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838), suggests that it may be of considerable antiquity, perhaps dating to the mid-eighteenth century.  This building forms the centrepiece of a group of related structures along with the outbuildings to the rear and the gateway (13401926) to the southwest, which was probably added during the second half of the nineteenth century.  The cut stone bellcote to the gable end of one of the buildings is an interesting feature that helps give this particularly outbuilding a strong character above its modest size, and also indicates that this was a prosperous farm at the time of construction.

It is built in a subdued Gothic style and retains much of its early fabric including good quality metal fittings to the window.  The contrast between the dressed limestone masonry to the walls with the smooth light grey ashlar detailing creates an appealing tonal and textural appearance.  This church was built to designs by John Bourke (died 1871), a noted exponent of the Early English Gothic style, of which this is a subdued example.  It was built shortly after 1860 and expected cost was £650 (IAA).  The detailing to this church is similar to St. Mary's Roman Catholic church (15402304) at Drumraney in County Westmeath, which Bourke designed in 1857.  The present church is built just to the north of the site of an earlier T-plan Roman Catholic chapel, demolished by c. 1913 (Ordnance Survey six-inch maps 1838, 1913).  It is unusual that this church does not have an attached bell tower or bellcote, which are usually found at Roman Catholic churches/chapels built in Ireland around this date.

It is elevated above other houses/farmhouses in the locality by its larger scale and the inclusion of elaborate detailing such as a decorative fanlight and ornate cast-iron entrance porch.  The cast-iron entrance porch was probably added during the late-nineteenth century and adds artistic appeal to the front elevation.  The appearance and detailing to this of this house suggests that it was built during the early-nineteenth century.  However, it is not depicted on an 1838 map (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map) of the area, although a number of the outbuildings are indicated, suggesting that it was constructed shortly afterwards.  The present building replaced an earlier house to site, which was located adjacent to the southwest of the present edifice.  The substantial complex of outbuildings to the rear add considerably to the setting and historic context of the house, providing an insight into the extensive resources required to run a middle-sized holding in Ireland during the nineteenth century.

Built of locally quarried 'pudding stone' and now disused, this appealing structure retains many early and attractive features including timber sliding sash windows and a fine double leaf door with ornate overlight.  The simple but attractive doorway with leaded overlight adds interest to the plain front elevation.  This doorway is probably a later addition, perhaps added when the building was converted to use as a private dwelling.  The form of the building suggests that it originally had two classrooms, one to the upper floor and one to the ground floor, which were probably separate classrooms for girls and boys as was common during the nineteenth century.  The site of the porch to the rear may define the location of separate access to the schoolmaster's dwelling. This building was later converted to use as a farmhouse, c. 1880, and the outbuildings to the rear were built at this time.  These outbuildings survive in good condition and add considerably to the setting of this building.  This building is of social and historical interest as one of the earliest extant school building in the locality.  This building may have been converted to a dwelling following the construction of the school house at Ballycloghan (altered, not in survey) to the northeast during the late-nineteenth century.

The three-bay two-storey form is typical of Church of Ireland rectory buildings (particularly those built by the Board of First Fruits), and many middle class gentleman’s residences, dating from the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century.  It also retains much of itself early fabric including interesting Wyatt style windows to the ground floor openings with fluted columns flanking the central window openings, Tuscan columns flanking the doorway, and an early timber panelled door with fielded panels.  The leaded fanlight to the front face of the porch adds further decorative interest.  The form of the projecting central porch is unusual, suggesting that it may have been a later addition perhaps using earlier fabric (doorcase; fanlight to front elevation).  This building is of social interest to the local area on account of its original intended function as a Church of Ireland rectory associated with St. Anne’s Church of Ireland church (13401922), which lies adjacent to the northeast.  Recessed from the road and approached by a long curving driveway, this former rectory adds historic interest to its pleasant rural location and is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.  Lewis (1837) records that the associated church (13401922) a ‘plain building with a square tower, was erected in 1814, for which the late Board of First Fruits granted a loan of £368.  The glebe-house was built by aid of a gift of £350 and a loan of £450 from the same Board’.  The cost of its construction was £923 (Irish Parliamentary Returns 1837). It is not clear if the rectory was built in 1814 or if it was in already in existence by this date, with the church being a later addition (possibly replacing the earlier, now ruinous, church at nearby Foxhall Glebe (13315009) to the southeast).  However there are references to a Revd. Sir Henry Bate (later Bate-Dudley) living at Kilglass Rectory in County Longford from 1807 until 1812.  He was granted this rectory after representation by the Duke of Bedford, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, after Bate-Dudley failed to receive a church commission in his native England.  Bate-Dudley was a figure of some importance and was made a baronet in 1813.  He also was also an eminent magistrate and an author of some repute.  Kilglass rectory was the home of a Revd. Robert Jessop in 1824 (Pigot’s Directory) and in 1837 (Lewis).  Revd. Jessop was rector of Kilglass from 1813 until 1841 (Newspaper).  It was later the residence of a Rev.

It was altered in 1860 (IAA) by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners (1833 – 1870), and it is possible that the apse was added at this date (map information).  The wall monuments to the interior of this church were moved to St. John’s Church of Ireland church (13309011), Edgeworthstown, c. 1990.  The collection of stone grave markers to site, some of artistic merit, add to the setting and context of the churchyard.

The stepped roofline and clustered diagonally-set chimneystacks creates a varied and visually interesting silhouette in the rural landscape.  This building is built on the site of a number of earlier buildings (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838) and may contain fabric from these earlier structures (the gable-fronted block to the southeast end is on the same footprint as a building depicted on this map).  The carved stone coat-of-arms to the gable apex of the block to the southeast is an interesting feature of some artistic merit, and may be the crest of the family that built or rebuilt this house.  The simple but attractive wrought-iron gates to the southwest of the site define a now disused entrance, which curved in from the impressive and striking long straight driveway that approaches the house from the main entrance gates (13401923) further to the southwest.  The lands (‘held by deed forever’) around this house apparently belonged to the Fox family of nearby Foxhall (now demolished) c. 1835 (O’Donovan Letters).  Lewis (1837) records that ‘Slyan is the seat of J. Black, Esq’ and the site may have historical connections with the Black family, who lived at Slynan, Slyan or Slynane (various names given) near Legan during the eighteenth century.  It was later the home of a John Fleming, Esq. in 1846 (Slater’s Directory).

This particular school was built in 1937 (OPW).  Its form suggests that it was originally built as a two classroom school, possibly with separate classrooms for boys and girls as was common practice at the time of construction.  This impression is reinforced by the boundary wall to the rear, which divides the yard into two separate enclosed spaces.

It survives in good condition, despite being unoccupied for many years (until recent works 2008/9), which is testament to the quality of its original construction.  The symmetry to the front elevation, the central doorway, the high raised basement, the hipped slate roof with a pair of central chimneystacks and the diminishing window openings all help to give this building quite a formal architectural character for what is, in essence, a small-scale vernacular farmhouse.  The dressed plinth blocks to the main doorway are another interesting feature that elevate this house above many of its contemporaries in the area.  The outbuildings to the rear of the house add to the setting and context.  One of these outbuildings has a chimneybreast to the west gable end and was probably originally in use as an earlier dwelling to site.  This building is of mud-walled construction over rubble stone footings, and is an interesting and rare survival of what maybe an eighteenth-century single-storey vernacular house.  The present dwelling house was reputedly built by a James Kenny (died 1891), who built the house, c. 1865, on returning to Longford after residing in America for a number of years.

The small irregularly-spaced openings, simple materials, and the positioning of outbuildings to the front of this house are indicative of its vernacular origins.  The simple form makes a pleasing silhouette against the skyline.  The steep pitch of the corrugated-metal roof suggests that this building was formerly thatched.  The junction of the extension with the main body of the house indicates that the roof also suggests that this building was formerly thatched.  The position of one of the chimneystacks, which is roughly in line with the main entrance, hints that this building has the lobby-entry plan that is characteristic of the vernacular dwellings of the midlands of Ireland.  This building is the only survival from a nucleated settlement at Cornapark, which is indicated on an 1838 map of the area (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map) but was cleared/demolished by 1914 (Ordnance Survey third edition six-inch map.  This simple dwelling is a modest element of the vernacular heritage of County Longford and, sensitively restored, would be an integral element of the county.  Cornapark was described c. 1835 as ‘Bishop Land, held under a lease of 21 years by Sir George Featherstone, Bart (Of Ardagh House)….

The churchyard contains the remains of a late medieval church (LF021-033001-) and was the site of St. Catherine’s Church of Ireland church, which was built in 1816 (at a cost of £738) and was demolished at some stage over the last few decades.  The graveyard contains an interesting and varied collection of cut stone grave markers (of recumbent, upstanding, box/table, and wall monuments), some of which are of high artistic merit.

This gateway retains dressed limestone gate piers that are finely sculpted with ornate ball finials decorated with carved seraphim and engraved lettering.  A plaque to one of the piers indicates that these piers were erected in 1798 by William Gleadowe Newcomen, who lived at Carrigglas Manor (13401414) to the northeast.  The date of the erection of these piers suggests that they may have been erected to commemorate of celebrate the (failure) of the Rebellion of 1798.  The level of craftsmanship involved in the construction of these gate piers is of the highest quality, and they serve as a reminder of the skill of local stonemasons and sculptors at the time of their construction.  The gate piers provide important context to the locality and form an attractive roadside feature.  The oval-shaped enclosure (LF021-033----) that surrounds the site suggests that there was an early medieval church/monastic foundation here, possibly associated with the extensive ecclesiastic site on Inchcleraun Island, which is located nearby on an island in Lough Ree to the west.

The early to mid twentieth century saw a resurgence in the popularity of small pane windows such as the six-over-six timber sliding sash windows as utilised in this building.  Of particular note is the carved limestone plaque to the northeast elevation, which was erected in 1917 and commemorates the death of Thomas Ashe (1885 – 1917), who was a battalion commander during the 1916 Easter Rising.  Ashe was captured at nearby Ballinalee in August 1917, whilst giving a public speech, and later died whilst on hunger strike on the 25th of September.  It is possible that this building was extant in 1917 and was converted to a new use.  This building was apparently opened on St. Patrick’s Day 1918.  Sinn Finn was popular in Longford at this time and Joe McGuinness, a political prisoner at the time, was elected a Sinn Fein MP for south County Longford in 1917 and 1918.  The hall was built by a newly formed Sinn Fein club with voluntary local labour.

Outbuildings to the south of site (not investigated).","This substantial house/farmhouse, of mid-to-late nineteenth-century appearance, retains its early character and form.  The narrow plan, the pitched slate roof with large end chimneystacks, and the long narrow window openings all indicate an early date for this building.  A subdued classical influence can be seen in the central breakfront, the symmetrical proportions to the front elevation, the diminishing window openings, and the central doorcase.  The fine cut stone block-and-start doorcase is strongly detailed and, along with the splayed flight of steps, makes a dramatic entrance to the house and provides a central focus.  The window frames are early (almost set flush with the facades) but the original multi-paned timber sliding sash windows were replaced by single-paned sashes c. 1900.  The associated outbuildings to the south and walled garden further contribute to the site, adding context to the setting and providing an interesting historical insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a middle-sized landholding in Ireland during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

It represents a typical example of the dwellings built by middle-sized farmers and professionals during the nineteenth century.  The loss of the original fittings to the openings, and the removal of the rendered finish, fails to detract substantially form its visual expression.  While the three-bay two-storey elevation with hipped roof and paired central chimneystacks is a recurring motif in middle-sized houses in the Irish rural landscape, this example is notable for its broad façade and large scale.

This building is an example of the language of classical architecture stripped to its barest fundamental elements, which creates a fine dwelling in a subtle style.  This is exhibited through features such as the rigid symmetry to the main elevation, the central round-headed doorway, the diminishing window openings and centrally placed chimneystacks.  The sash windows to the front elevation are set against the front façade, which suggests that this building is quite early in date.  The largely blank rear elevation with small window openings would also suggest a relatively early date.  The fine ashlar limestone gate piers to the southwest add considerably to the setting.

Single-bay single-storey outbuilding to the southeast of house having rubble stone walls and pitched corrugated-metal roof.  Rubbles stone boundary walls to road-frontage and to site.","This sophisticated middle-sized house is one of the most important elements of the architectural heritage of County Longford.  Its design has been attributed to the eminent architect Richard Castle (died 1751) who was probably the foremost architect working in Ireland at the time of construction and has been credited with the dissemination of the Palladian architectural style throughout rural Ireland.  Ledwithstown House has quite a robust appearance on account of the heavy parapet with pronounced eaves cornice and by the large tall ashlar chimneystacks that are aligned along with the front elevation.  Although built using rubble stone masonry, this building is well-detailed with high quality, if robust, cut limestone trim in features like the window surrounds and the heavy eaves cornice.  The good-quality dressed limestone quoins to the corners help to emphasise the stocky appearance of this building.  The fine Tripartite doorcase with pediment is strongly detailed and provides a central focus to the main elevation.  This central focus is further enhanced by the flight of cut stone steps with flanking walls having splayed bases.  The house is further enhance by its long and straight drive aligned with the centre of the front elevation, which creates a sense of grandeur and generates a sense of anticipation when approaching the house.  The well-crafted gate piers at the start of this driveway complete the setting and add substantially to this important composition.  This building has been recently restored after a long period of near-derelict.  Ledwithstown House was the home of the Ledwith family from its construction until c. 1900.  The Ledwith family were an important in County Longford from c. 1650, and throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and a number of family members served as Grand Jurors and as High Sheriff of the county (High Sheriffs included George Ledwith in 1764 - 5; James in 1792 - 3, Richard in 1807 and Edward in 1847 - 8).",1745,1750,National,house,210880,259444,610829,759465,53.58494641,-7.836453904,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402217_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402217,SURV018

The single-storey building to the northwest was apparently in use as a coaching inn (local information).  However, this building was constructed during the second half of the nineteenth century (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838), so it is more likely that the two-storey building is a former inn.

Associated Church of Ireland church (13313025) to the north in Keenagh, and former church (13402211) to the southwest.","This well-proportioned former Church of Ireland rectory retains its early form, character and fabric.  This building is an example of the language of classical architecture stripped to its barest fundamental elements, which creates a fine dwelling in a subtle style.  This is exhibited through features such as the rigid symmetry to the main elevation, the central doorway, the diminishing window openings and centrally placed chimneystacks.  The three-bay two-storey form is typical of Church of Ireland rectory buildings (particularly built by the Board of First Fruits), and many middle class gentleman’s residences, dating from the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century.  The projecting brick porch to the front elevation may be a later addition, perhaps added during the mid-to-late nineteenth century.  This porch is unusual in that it has doors to two elevations, which are reached by flights of cut stone steps.  The cast-iron railings to the east side of the porch add an element of artistic interest to the main elevation.  This building is of social interest to the local community as a former Church of Ireland rectory.  The location of this former rectory and the associated outbuildings suggests that it was originally associated with the now ruinous church (13402211) to the southwest and that it predates the construction of the Church of Ireland church (13313025) at Keenagh to the north (built in 1832).  It was altered or rebuilt c. 1827 at a cost of £784, of which £692 was a loan, and £92 a gift from the Board of First Fruits (Irish Parliamentary Returns 1837).  This rectory forms part of a pair of related sites along with the associated outbuildings (13402209), and part of a notable group of related structures along with the fine Church of Ireland church at Keenagh (13313025) to the north and the ruinous church (13402211) to the southwest.  Situated in attractive mature grounds, this building is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.  The simple but appealing wrought-iron gates to the north complete the setting.  It is possible that this rectory originally dates to 1795 (documentary source).  It was described by Lewis (1837) as being in the patronage of the Archbishop of Tuam, and having a glebe of 173 acres.  It was possibly the residence of a Benjamin Cronin/Cronyn between 1827 – 1832.  It was described as the ‘the property of the Revd. G. Britton, held by a deed for ever,’ c. 1835 (O’Donovan Letters), the residence of the Rev. J. Armstrong and Rev. K.

Some of the railings an gates are said to have been moved here from Newcastle Demesne (13402709) to the southeast (local information).  Loughan House was the home of the Crawford family during the first half to the nineteenth century.  It was described in 1835 as the ‘property of Mr. Crawford, held by a deed for ever, c. 1835 (O’Donovan Letters).  There are associations between the Crawford family and Loughan dating back to the middle of the eighteenth century, when a James Crawford (1734 – 1793) lived in the area.  This suggests that there was an earlier house at Loughan or, perhaps, that the present house was remodeled at the start of the nineteenth century.  Loughan House was later the home of the Ferrall family from the late-nineteenth century, and may have been sold c. 1862.",1800,1830,Regional,house,215108,263641,615055,763662,53.62255611,-7.772423632,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402302_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402302,SURV018

The modest façade of this house is enhanced by the survival of the timber sash windows and by timber battened door with fanlight over.  The pitched natural slate roof, widely-spaced window openings and the form of the timber sash windows suggest that this building may be of considerable antiquity, perhaps dating the late-eighteenth or very early-nineteenth century.  This building has features from both the vernacular tradition (irregularly-spaced window openings; set at a right-angle to the road alignment) and from the more formal architectural tradition (fanlight doorcase).  It is possible that this was originally a single-storey vernacular building with the first floor added at a later date, a feature that is sometimes encountered with buildings of this type. The position of the chimneystacks suggests that this building was extended to the southwest by a bay at some stage.  This site was described as ‘the property of T.F. Jessop, Esq. of Doory Hall, and John Lennon, who resides in the townland’, c. 1835 (O’Donovan Letters), and was later in the ownership of a Patrick Lennon c. 1855 (Griffith’s Valuation).

Gateway flanked by sections of rendered boundary wall.  Remains of motte and bailey (LF023-019----) located in grounds just to the northeast of house.","This interesting, robust and substantial house retains much of its early form and character.  The recent loss of the original fittings to the openings fails to detract substantially from its visual expression.  The narrow plan with central return to rear (possibly a stair return), and the pitched roof with end chimneystacks suggest that this building is of considerable antiquity, perhaps dating to the first half of the eighteenth century.  The unusual proportions to the front elevation are primarily due to the large space between the top of the first floor window openings and the eaves.  This suggests that this building formerly had a steeper pitched roof that was subsequently changed to the present profile, or that it possibly originally had a second floor.  According to local information, this building was thatched until the late-nineteenth century when the roof was rebuilt.  However, it would be highly unusual to have at thatched roof on a building of this type and scale.  The well-crafted gate posts to the south add considerably to the setting of this notable composition, which is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.  Richmount was the home of the Richardson family from the middle of the eighteenth century.  It was the residence of James Richardson c. 1780 (died 1785/6).  A Mr. Achmuty/Auchmuty Richardson of Richmount served as high sheriff of County Longford in 1811.  The Richardson family also owned Richfort House, now demolished (gateway remains 13401904) to the northwest of Ardagh during the eighteenth century up until the mid-nineteenth century.  Richmount later passed into the ownership Moffet family (probably through marriage with Richardson family) of nearby Park Place (house demolished).  It was later the residence of a Dr. Huggins M.D. (died 1847), a relative of the Moffet family, who apparently served as an army doctor at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

Located to the northwest of Barry and the east of Keenagh.  Rendered and rubble stone boundary walls to site.","This substantial complex of outbuildings associated with Lislea House (13402305) retains its early character and form, and provides historical context to the setting of the main house.  The survival of many original features and materials, such as natural slate roofs, mixed fixed and timber sash windows add a patina of age to these simple utilitarian buildings.  The dressed limestone voussoirs to the carriages arches help create textural variation.  The scale of these outbuildings provides an interesting historical insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a middle-sized landholding in rural Ireland during the nineteenth century.  These outbuildings were built in two distinct stages, indicated by the two date stones (1823 and 1865) and by cartographic information (Ordnance Survey six-inch sheets 1838 and 1913).  The date stones are interesting features that help add historic value to the outbuildings.  The simple rubble stone gate piers, boundary walls and the wrought-iron gates to site add further to the setting and complete this composition.  Lislea was described as ‘the property of Henry Smith, Esq., held under a deed for ever’, c. 1835 (O’Donovan Letters).  It was the home of a John Crawford Bickerstaff J.P. (died 1848) in the 1830s and 1840s (Lewis Topographical Dictionary 1837; will).  The Crawford family also had a seat at Loughan House (13402301), which is located a short distance to the north of Lislea.  It was later the residence of a George Henry Barrett (leased from Smith family) c. 1860 (Griffith’s Valuation) and of a John Bickerstaff in 1881 and 1894 (Slater’s Directories).

Segmental-headed carriage arches to all ranges having roughly dressed limestone voussoirs and voussoirs.  Corrugated-metal doors to a number of openings.  Modern square-headed carriage arch to the northwest end of front elevation (southwest) of outbuilding to the northeast having sheet metal sliding door.  Set back from road in own grounds with modern house (southeast) and outbuildings/farm outbuildings to site.  Located to the west of Legan.  Concrete and gravel yard to forecourt of outbuildings.  Pedestrian gateway to the northeast comprising a pair of cut limestone gate posts (on square-plan) having projecting plinths to base, cut limestone shafts having chamfered edges, moulded limestone caps and having a hooped wrought-iron gate with cast-iron fittings.  Rendered rubble stone boundary walls to site.","Although now in a poor condition, these two-storey outbuildings retains much of their early form and character.  Much of the early fabric survives including cut stone eaves courses, while the outbuilding to the southwest survive in good condition and retains a natural slate roof.  The simple forms and rubble stone construction is indicative of their original functional use.  They were built to serve Tully House, now demolished and replaced by a modern house, and their scale provides an interesting historical insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a middle-sized landholding in Ireland during the nineteenth century.  The exterior steps to the northeast range is an interesting feature allowing direct access to the upper loft.  The well-detailed pedestrian gateway to the northeast adds an element of artistic interest to the site.  The quality of the carving to the gate posts is indicative of the high quality craftsmanship available at the time of construction.  Tully was described in 1835 as the ‘property of the Countess Dowager of Rosse, held in deed forever (O’Donovan Letters).  It was leased to a John Millar for 21 years in 1835 (deed) and it is probable that the outbuildings were constructed shortly after this date.  Tully was later the home of a George H Miller in 1894 (Slater’s Directory).

Set back from road in own grounds to the northwest of Barry.  Rubble limestone boundary walls to site.","This substantial walled garden was originally built to serve Park Place House, now demolished.  The walled garden survives in relatively good condition and retains its early form and character.  Although the main house has now been demolished the architectural detailing evident in the walled garden, such as the cut capping stones and the good quality dressed limestone block-and-start surrounds to the integral pedestrian gateways, indicates its association with a large country house of architectural design.  The scale of the walled garden provides an interesting historical insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a middle-sized country estate in Ireland during the nineteenth century, and also acts as an historical reminder of the now demolished main house.  It would have been originally used to grow a wide variety of produce for use in the main house.  The simple outbuildings to the west of the garden survive in relatively good condition.  Of particular note is the small-scale outbuilding to the north, which has good quality dressed limestone quoins to the corners, a natural slate roof and retains metal-framed pivoting window fittings to the openings.  The robust gateway to the north of the site is well-built using good quality masonry and retains wrought-iron gates.  This gateway adds substantially to the setting and completes this composition.  Park Place House was the home of the Moffet family during the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century (A Revd. Robert Moffett (died 1819) lived here from about 1786).  It was the residence of a John R. Robinson, Treasurer of the Grand Jury in Longford in 1837 (the Robinson family had their main seat at nearby Lisglassock House, and John Robinson may have moved back to Lissglassock following the death as his father, also John, in 1839).

13402310,Lisglassock House,,,,,LISGLASSOCK,Longford,LF,LF,"Detached five-bay two-storey house, built c. 1810 and possibly incorporating earlier fabric, with return and extension to rear (northwest).  Now disused.  Hipped natural slate roof with pair of ashlar limestone chimneystacks having terracotta chimney pots and cast-iron rainwater goods.  Brick chimneystack and rendered chimneystack to rear return.  Roughcast rendered walls over smooth rendered plinth course.  Square-headed window openings with central Wyatt/tripartite window to central bay at first floor level, three-over-three pane timber sliding sash windows to remaining first floor window openings and timber casement windows to ground floor, all having tooled limestone sills.  Paired two-over-two pane timber sliding sash windows to rear elevation (northwest) at Central round-headed door opening to main elevation (southeast) with timber panelled door flanked by sidelights and having wide timber spoked fanlight above.

Rubble stone boundary walls to site; partially roughcast rendered rubble stone boundary wall to the northwest of house having integral square-headed pedestrian gateway.  Main entrance gateway to the east, at start of long approach avenue to house, having remains of cast-iron gates and a modern mild steel farm gate.","Although now unoccupied, this fine and well-proportioned house retains its early form and character.  The wide central fanlit doorway, the shallow hipped roof and the central Wyatt window at first floor level gives this building a Regency feel, suggesting that it was built or rebuilt during the first decades of the nineteenth century.  This building also remains much of its early fabric, including timber sliding sash windows.  The low roofline and the squat window openings at first floor level help this building quite a robust architectural character.  The wide fanlit doorway with the Wyatt window over provides an attractive central focus to the main façade and adds decorative interest to the otherwise plain front façade (south).  This building is an example of the language of classical architecture stripped to its barest fundamental elements, which creates a fine dwelling in a subtle style.  This is exhibited through features such as the rigid symmetry to the main elevation, the central round-headed doorway, the diminishing window openings and centrally placed chimneystacks.  The form of this building is typical of many middle-sized rural houses dating to the first decades of the nineteenth century and built by prosperous farmers, professionals, clergy and members of the minor gentry.  The timber casement windows at ground floor level, and possibly the doorway with sidelights, to the front elevation were probably added c. 1900.  The simple collection of outbuildings to the rear and the rubble stone boundary walls to site add considerably to the setting of this notable composition.  The present building may contain the fabric of an earlier building to site, and it was the residence of a Robertson (Robinson) Esq. c. 1780 (Taylor and Skinner map 1777 – 1783).  There are references to the Robinson family at Lissglassock/Lisglassoge dating back to the start of the eighteenth century (1717 and 1725).  Lisglassock House was the home of a John Robinson Esq. in 1837 (Lewis).  John Robertson (1766 – 1839) was an important person in County Longford, serving as High Sheriff in 1809, and as a grand juror and as a magistrate for almost 40 years.  The Robinson family (John Robinson) also had a seat at nearby Park Place c. 1837, now demolished (13402308).  The Robinson family were still resident at Lisglassock in 1901.

Sections of rubble stone boundary wall to either side (southwest and northeast).  Located to the northwest of Doory Hall (in ruins), at the start of a long approach avenue, and to the southeast of Keenagh and the northeast of Barry.","This fine gateway acts as a suitably impressive entrance to the once important Doory Hall demesne.  The simple but well-crafted gate piers are robustly built in good quality dressed ashlar limestone masonry, while the elaborate cast-iron gates are notable examples of nineteenth century metallurgy.  This was probably a secondary entrance to Doory Hall, with the fine gateway (13402327) and gate lodge (13402326) to the southeast representing the main gateway to this once very fine demesne and house.  It may have been erected c. 1820, at the same time that the eminent architect John Hargrave (1788 – 1833) rebuilt Doory Hall itself for the Jessop family.  This gateway forms part of an extensive collection of structures and features associated with Doory Hall, along with the ruins of the main house (13314005), walled garden (13314003), the former estate worker’s house/possible school (13314014) and extensive complex of outbuildings (1314001) to the southeast; and the probably main gateway (13402327) and associated gate lodge (13402326) located to the southeast of the main house.

Entrance gateway to yard to the southeast comprising a pair of rendered rubble stone gate piers (on square-plan) having a pair of wrought-iron flat bar gates.","This substantial two-storey outbuilding, of mid-to-late nineteenth century appearance, retains its early form and character.  This building is well-proportioned and robustly built, while the advanced gable-fronted bay to the centre with cut stone detailing lends it a formal architectural character that is vaguely classical.  The survival of many original features and materials, such the cut limestone string course and the clockface with cut limestone surround to the advanced central bay, the ornate timber barge boards, the timber sash windows, and the dressed limestone voussoirs to the carriage arch enhance the architectural significance of the building, while adding visual appeal.  This building forms part of a pair of related structures along with Sunfield House (13402313) to the southeast, and is a integral element of the built heritage of the local area.  The simple wrought-iron gates to the entrance add to the setting.  The construction of this substantial outbuilding c. 1875, indicates that this was a prosperous farm holding during the mid-to-late nineteenth century.  This site is associated with the Butler family, and was apparently the home of a Richard Butler (born 1785 died 1850 in United States) during the early nineteenth century.  The house may have been originally built c. 1813 following his marriage to a member of the Huggins family, who resided at nearby Richmount and Richfort houses at various times throughout the nineteenth century.

Gateway flanked to either side by sections of  cast-iron pedestrian gates having anthemion-type finials over.  Car park to the south.  Associated parochial house adjacent to the north (not in survey).","This simple Roman Catholic church retains much of its early form and character.  It was originally built as a typical early nineteenth-century T-plan chapel, which were built in great numbers throughout the Irish countryside in the years before and immediately after Catholic Emancipation (1829).  Its simple unadorned form is indicative of the relative lack of resources available to the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland at the time of construction.  The chancel and the unusual off-set belltower were added in 1891, and this belltower helps gives this building a distinctive profile in the rural landscape.  The pointed arch window openings give this building the bare minimum of a Gothic Revival character.  The good quality cut stone tracery to the window openings, which was probably added in 1891, is indicative of high quality craftsmanship and help to add a decorative element to this otherwise plain edifice.  The good quality cast-iron entrance gates, which may have been moved here from another location, add further decorative interest to this site.  This building is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area, and has played an important role in the social history of Carrickedmond/Taghshinny area for the last two centuries.  The Rev. Edward McGaver was the parish priest here in 1837 (Lewis; list of subscribers).  The church was built on land owned by the Jessop family of nearby Doory Hall (13314005) at the time of construction.  The Rev. McGaver also built the Roman Catholic church (13402113) at nearby Newtown-Cashel in 1833, and may have been responsible for the construction of this church at Carrickedmond around the same time.  McGaver later became a canon and was responsible for the construction of the fine St. Mary’s Church (13305005) in Granard c. 1860.

Simple single-arch bridges of this type are a feature of the rural Irish landscape but the majority of these have been altered in road-widening schemes etc. over the years, which makes this a relatively rare intact example.  The simple form of this road bridge is enhanced by the textural variation created by the rubble stone spandrel walls and parapets with the dressed limestone voussoirs to the single small arch.  The bridge serves as a reminder of the quality of the engineering and local craftsmen's skills.  It probably dates to the late- eighteenth or the early-nineteenth century, a period that saw a great deal of bridge building in Ireland, particularly by the Grand Juries (the forerunners of the County Councils).  The cut stone stile built into the parapet wall to the southeast corner is an interesting feature that adds further interest.  This feature gives access to two holy wells associated with St. Columbkille, which attests to a long standing social importance of this location.

It also retains much of its early fabric including latticed glazed timber casement windows and a natural slate roof.  The rubble stone construction to the main body of the building indicates that it was formerly rendered, but its removal fails to detract substantially form its appearance.  A number of the ground floor window openings appear to have been formerly doorways, later partially infilled.  This building is of historical and social importance as a former Royal Irish Constabulary barracks from c. 1830 (O’Donovan Letters c. 1835; Ordnance Survey six-inch first edition map 1837), and it is one of a number of former police barracks in the Abbeyshrule area (there was formerly a barracks in Abbeyshrule village, now demolished).

Complex of outbuildings (13402322) to the north/northwest.","This interesting and substantial house, of early eighteenth-century appearance, retains much of its early character and form.  It retains some of its early fabric although the loss of a number of the early fittings to the openings, and the construction of a modern lean-to extension to the northwest side of the projecting central bay, detract somewhat from its architectural character.  The proportions of this building, the form of the window openings, and the pitched slate roof with end chimneystacks indicates that this is a building of considerable antiquity.  The projecting central bay was probably added sometime during the second half of the nineteenth century.  The good quality carved limestone doorcase, which adds an element of artistic interest to the otherwise plain front elevation, was probably moved to its present location following the construction of the projecting central bay.  The timber bargeboards to the southeast gable end, and the roof structure (with overhanging eaves) may also have been altered at this time.  This building forms the centrepiece in a group of related structures along with the complex of outbuildings (13402322) to the north, and is an integral element of the built heritage of County Longford.  This house was originally built by the Wilder family during the first decades of the eighteenth century, and possibly slightly earlier.  There are references to the Wilder family in County Longford from the mid-seventeenth century (a Matthew Wilder of Cliduff (former name of house is Cloghdoo) is indicated in the 1659 Census of County Longford, and a Matthew Wilder was appointed as a Commissioner for County Longford from 1697 - 99; an Edward Wilder was a soldier in the 1649 Irish Confederate Wars), which suggests the presence of an earlier house/castle on or close to the site of the present structure.  Castlewilder was the home of a William Wilder (1696 – 1745), during the first half of the eighteenth century, and he served as High Sheriff of County Longford in 1730.  It remained in the ownership of the Wilder family (with a Matthew Wilder serving as High Sheriff in 1774, and his son, also Matthew, as High Sheriff in 1798) throughout the eighteenth and into the nineteenth century.  This house was possibly the home of Theaker Wilder (c. 1717 – c. 1777; son of Matthew Wilder), a mathematician, and first Regius Professor of Greek and Senior Register at Trinity College, Dublin.  He is notable for being Oliver Goldsmith's (rather dismissive) tutor whilst he was at Trinity c. 1747.  Castlewilder went into the ownership of the Pollock family c. 1823 (possibly leased), and was the home of a Hugh Pollock Esq. in 1837 (Lewis).  A Richard Riggs Shaw J.P. was born here in 1823.  Lewis (1837) records that ‘petty sessions are carried out at Castlewilder every alternate week’.  The Castlewilder estate was sold in 1845 for a sum of £18,000 (or £13,800) to a Surgeon Richard Pearce O’Reilly (1793 – 1870) of Sackville Street in Dublin.  The sale included ‘house, office and 752 acres of land’ of which 700 acres was described as ‘excellent arable, meadow and pasture land’, and c. 32 acres as ‘ornamental timber’.

Central gateway flanked to either side (northeast and southwest) by sections of cast-iron railings with cast-iron spear finals and having a single cast-iron pedestrian gate to either side.  Located to the southeast of Doory Hall (in ruins), at the start of a long approach avenue, and to the southeast of Keenagh and the east of Barry.  Set slightly back from road with associated single-storey gate lodge (13402326) to the southwest side.  Ruinous single-storey gate lodge located to the northeast of gates, only southeast wall survives.  Modern two-storey house located along avenue to the northeast.","This attractive gateway acts as a suitably impressive entrance to the once important Doory Hall demesne.  This gateway differs from the more commonly encountered entrance gateways serving large country houses in that it does not have stone gate piers or gate posts.  The elaborate cast-iron gates and railings are notable examples of nineteenth-century ironmongery, while the appealing wrought-iron end finials to the central gates are indicative of high quality craftsmanship.  The location of this gateway, located at the start of a long approach avenue that runs to the front of the house, suggests that this was the main gateway serving the Doory Hall (13314005) estate.  This gateway formerly had two entrance lodges, one located to the southwest on the site of the present lodge (13402326) and one to the northeast of which only one wall is now extant.  This gateway probably dates to the extensive remodelling of Doory Hall that was carried out to designs the eminent architect John Hargrave (1788 – 1833) for the Jessop family c. 1820 (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838).  This gateway forms part of a pair of related structures along with the associated gate lodge to the southwest; and part of a wider collection of structures and features associated with Doory Hall, along with the ruins of the main house (13314005), walled garden (13314003), the former estate worker’s house/possible school (13314014) and extensive complex of outbuildings (1314001) to the northwest.

Located to the east end of the village green at Taghshinny, and to the east of Barry and to the northwest of Abbeyshrule.  Associated Church of Ireland rectory (13402330) adjacent to the east.","This interesting Church of Ireland church retains it early form and character.  The later porch to the southwest gable end detracts somewhat from its visual expression.  The simple form of this church is enlivened by the good-quality detailing to the window openings, which have ornate timber Y-tracery with metal framed windows to the nave openings and intersecting cut stone tracery with stained glass windows to the chancel/northeast gable end.  The very fine and elegant cut stone memorial built into the southeast elevation of the nave, which commemorates Nugent family of Colehill (probably of nearby Colehill House - 13402332) and dates to the 1760s, adds further artistic merit to the exterior elevation.  This monument is possibly built using a reused doorcase formerly standing at Tennalick House (13402348) to the south (local information).  The execution of the stonework to the bellcote is of a high quality, and gives this building a strong presence in the landscape that belies its small-scale.  The pointed arch doorway to the porch was probably moved from the main body of the church and installed in its present location when the porch was constructed.  This church was reputedly built or rebuilt by the Sankey and/or the Gore family (later Barons Annaly) of Tennalick House (13402348) to the southeast during the late-seventeenth or early-eighteenth century.  However, it now has a predominately late-eighteenth or early-nineteenth century appearance following extensive alterations in 1784 and c. 1825 (possibly at the same time the associated Church of Ireland rectory (13402330) was constructed).  The bellcote may be a slightly later addition, and is of a form that is found at Church of Ireland churches built or altered c. 1860.  Lewis (1837) records, ‘the church: is a small building, without tower or steeple, erected about a century ago; it has lately undergone considerable repairs, towards which the Countess Dowager of Rosse contributed £150, Mr. Jessop £50, Mrs. Jessop £50, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners £50; it contains a handsome marble monument to the memory of Judge Gore’.  The fine marble memorial monument (to the interior), commemorating Judge Gore of nearby Tennalick House (13402348), is dated 1753 and is of high artistic merit with a late Baroque character.  It was carved by John Van Nost the Younger (c. 1710 - 1780), a London-born sculptor from a renowned family of sculptors.  He moved to Dublin in 1749 carried out a number of high profile commission in Ireland, including monuments to King George II (Weaver’s Hall, Dublin; another was formerly set on a bridge in Cork City but is now destroyed), statues of Mars and Justice (upper courtyard of Dublin Castle), a bronze equestrian statue of King George II that formerly stood in Stephen’s Green, Dublin (destroyed by a landmine in 1937), and a statue of George III for the Royal Exchange in Dublin (now City Hall).  The church is surrounded by a graveyard containing a collection of cut stone grave markers (upstanding, recumbent, box, type and vault-types), some of which are of high artistic merit, while a number of grave plots have cast- and wrought-iron railed enclosures.  The earliest legible grave marker is dated 1684 and commemorates (inscription) ‘Pierce Pettit who was murdered by Robert (surname chiseled off)’.  The graveyard contains the burial plots of a number of important local families including the Richardson family (probably of Richmount House (13402304) and/or Richfort House), the Jessop family of Doory Hall (13314005) and the Gore family of Tennalick House (13402348).  The good-quality gate piers to the entrance of the churchyard, and the rubble stone boundary walls, also add considerably to the setting and complete this notable composition.  The present church probably occupies the site of a medieval church, and there are references to a church here from 1227 (Annals of Loch Cé).  There are no visible signs of this early church although a number of medieval architectural fragments (LF023-097002-) are located close to the boundary wall to the north of the site.  There are two early medieval cross-slabs to site (LF023-097003-; LF023-097004-), of a type found at Clonmacnoise, which suggests that this may be the site of a much earlier church foundation.  This possible early medieval church may have been associated with the important monastic site at Inchcleraun, an island on Lough Ree to the west.  The present churchyard is also enclosed by a boundary wall on oval-plan, which may reflect the extent of an early medieval monastic enclosure.  This multi-period site is an important element of the built heritage of the local area and has probably provided a spiritual focus for the surrounding countryside for a considerable period of time.",1700,1830,Regional,graveyard/cemetery,219999,260318,619946,760339,53.59253246,-7.698714835,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402329_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402329,SURV018

Rubble limestone boundary walls to site.","This substantial former Church of Ireland rectory, of early nineteenth-century appearance, retains much of its early character and form.  The loss of the early window fittings fails to detract substantially from its architectural expression.  It has a number of interesting architectural features such as the shallow hipped roofs with overhanging bracketed eaves, ground floor windows set in shallow segmental-headed recess, and a decorative door surround with fanlight over.  The door surround now partially obscures the fanlight over, which suggests that it is a later addition.  It is built on a complex irregular-plan that helps create an interesting composition with different aspects to the main elevations.  It is built on a larger scale than many contemporaries of its type and forms an interesting pair of related structures along with the associated Church of Ireland church (13402329), which is located a short distance to the southwest.  This building represents more a small country house than a modest clergyman's dwelling and is an indication of the former prosperity of this parish (or the notable landowners that resided close by).  The now altered outbuilding to the rear, the rubble stone boundary walls to site, and the cast-iron water pump all add to the setting of this composition.  Lewis (1837) records that ‘the glebe-house was built in 1825, at an expense of £923 British, of which £230 was a gift and £507 a loan from the late Board of First Fruits’.  The present building probably replaced an earlier rectory on or close to this site as the associated Church of Ireland church originally dates to c. 1700.  The glebe land surrounding this rectory was in the ownership of a George Goslin (Gosselin), Esq., c. 1835 (O’Donovan Letters) and it was residence of a Rev. Nicholas Gosselin (died 1848) between 1835 and 1845 (newspaper article).  It was later the residence of a Revd. Hugh Crawford from 1855 (newspaper article); and later of the Revd.

13402347,Abbeyshrule Bridge,,,,Abbeyshrule,CLOONBRIN,Longford,LF,LF,"Double-arch road bridge over the River Inny, rebuilt c. 1860, incorporating the fabric of an earlier multiple-arched road bridge, c. 1750 (or earlier), to either side (northwest and southeast).  Segmental-headed arches with dressed limestone voussoirs having V-profile margins.  Squared rock-faced limestone spandrel walls, abutments and piers to central two arches having cut stone string courses at road deck level and cut stone string courses to impost level of arches/abutments.  Squared dressed limestone masonry to barrel.  Central pier projects upstream and downstream to form semi-circular cutwater with rounded capstones over.  Dressed ashlar limestone construction to parapets having cut stone coping over.  Projecting squared rock-faced limestone piers to either end of central double-arch section having cut stone string courses.  Ramped rubble limestone walls to either end of central arches (northwest and south), the fabric of an earlier bridge or bridges to site, having rubble stone walls with roughly cut stone coping over parapets.  Battered section to the southwest side of bridge, on southwest side, having two small round-headed arches with dressed limestone voussoirs.  Blocked arches with rubble stone voussoirs to the southeast.  Dressed limestone quoins to either end of battered section.  Located to the southeast of Abbeyshrule.","This interesting and imposing bridge contains spans a long-standing crossing point of the River Inny, and contains the fabric of at least two distinct stages of construction.  The impressive central two arches date to the mid-nineteenth century.  The good quality heavily rock-faced masonry used in the construction of these arches is a typical feature of the many bridges built throughout Ireland by the Board of Works in the mid nineteenth-century, and particularly between c. 1847 - 60, suggesting that they may have been responsible for its construction.  The cut stone detailing to this central section contrasts attractively with the rock-faced limestone construction of the spandrel walls, abutment and central pier, which creates an interesting architectural composition and an appealing visual contrast.  The two small round-headed arches to the southeast approach ramp are the remnants from an earlier bridge to site.  The simple forms of these arches are in contrast to the wide spans of the later central arches, providing an interesting historical insight into the development of bridge technology and engineering over a number of centuries.  The wide pier between these two arches suggests that this section probably dates to the first half of the eighteenth century, if not earlier.  The location of these two arches, well to the southwest of the present channel of the River Inny, indicates that the river was considerably wider at this point when the bridge was originally built, and that the channel was later dredged as part of drainage works (probably during the mid-nineteenth century, and at the same time the two central arches were built).  Lewis, writing in 1837, records that the bridge at ten arches at this time.  There is also a blocked arch to the southeast section of the bridge that has radially-set rubble stone voussoirs.  This arch may be of considerable antiquity, perhaps even pre-1700 in date.  There are a number of references to a bridge here from the mid-to-late seventeenth-century.  A bridge is indicated at Abbeyshrule in the Down Survey map of the area dated 1652, prepared by William Petty.  Nicholas Dowdall in 1682 described the bridge at Abbeyshrule as 'lately built by Robert Chawpen [Choppin] Esqr.’, and Piers (1684) also noted the construction of a bridge at Abbeyshrule.  This bridge is an important element of the built heritage of Longford, and has provided an important river crossing for a considerable period of time.",1740,1870,Regional,bridge,222750,259175,622696,759197,53.58215473,-7.657252751,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402347_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402347,SURV018
13402348,Tennalick House,,,,,TENNALICK,Longford,LF,LF,"Detached multiple-bay two-storey house, built c. 1710 and probably incorporating the fabric of an earlier house to site c. 1660.  Built on L-shaped plan comprising a five-bay two-storey range to the north with a four-bay two-storey range attached to the south end (running east-west).  Later partially in use as stables, and later as a dwelling again until c. 1960.  Now out of use, derelict and largely overgrown with vegetation.  External flight limestone steps (on dog leg-plan) to north gable end of block to the north, having red brick wall to exterior face, giving access to doorway at first floor level to northeast corner (rear).  Steeply pitched natural slate roofs with rendered chimneystacks, cast-iron rainwater goods and cut limestone eaves course.  Roughcast rendered walls with cut limestone string course between floors and chamfered cut stone plinth course to base.  Render now failing exposing rubble stone and squared rubble stone construction.  Square-headed window openings with tooled limestone sills; window fittings now largely removed although a number of multiple-pan timber sliding sash window with exposed sash boxes set flush to front elevation remain in-situ.  Number of window openings now blocked with brick infill.  Square-headed door openings to front elevation (west) of north wing and to north elevation and west gable end of range to south wing.  Carved limestone surrounds to door openings with architraves, and having flat friezes with moulded limestone cornices over.  Remains of timber spoked fanlight to the doorway to the north elevation of wing to south.  Some doorways now blocked with brick and rubble stone infill.  Interesting interior with groin vaulted roof to ground floor supported on carved limestone Doric columns/pilasters.  Set back from road in extensive mature grounds to the northeast of Ballymahon and the west of Abbeyshrule.  Later complex of outbuildings (13402355) arranged around a courtyard to the northeast.  Single-storey rubble stone outbuilding to the rear at the northeast end of range to north.  Possible remains of late seventeenth-century or early eighteenth-century formal garden to the west and northwest of house (LF023-122----).  Remains of walled garden on rectangular-plan to the southeast of house having rubble stone exterior walls faced internally with red brick having inlayed black brick diamond/diaper-work patterns.  Similar diaper-work pattern to east face of support wall of flight of exterior stone steps to house.  Rubble stone boundary walls to site.  Dressed and roughly dressed limestone gate piers (on square-plan) to site, some having wrought-iron gates and pedestrian gates.  Elaborate moulded limestone capstones to a number of gate piers (southeast of house), probably reused from an earlier building.  Remains of long straight approach avenue (‘the Long Avenue’), c. 2 miles in length, runs to house from the north.  Approach avenue now bisected by the Royal Canal a short distance to the north of the house.","Although now sadly derelict, this interesting building represents one of the more important and unusual elements of the architectural heritage of County Longford.  It was described by Craig (c. 1976) as ‘a very remarkable building indeed, unlike anything else in Ireland… it looks more like something in the Cotswolds than an Irish building’.  The former grandeur of this building can be seen in the elaborate cut stone doorcases with cornices, which are of high artistic merit, and by the cut stone plinth courses and string course.  The form of these doorcases suggests that they date to the early-eighteenth century.  The unusually steeply pitched roof is an interesting feature that gives this building a distinctive profile and a strong presence in the landscape.  It is possible that this building was originally constructed with pitched roofs to both ranges, with the an extra bay(s) added on at some stage and the roof profile changed to the present hipped end profile (the rear elevation (east) of the end bay of the north range is built entirely of brick, which is unlike the rest of the building; the proportions and spacing of the openings to the west elevation of the south range suggests that the end bay here is a later addition) It is also possible that the original building was much more extensive than is currently extant with part of the building later demolished during the late-eighteen/early-nineteenth century.  The building retains some of its original fabric including a number of timber sash windows with exposed sash boxes (of probable early eighteenth-century date), although a number of window fittings have been removed/vandalised in recent years which detracts from the architectural expression and character of this building.  The ground floor to the interior of this building is notable for the groin vaulted ceilings, which are supported on tooled limestone Doric columns/pilasters.  Some sections of plasterwork survive to the interior at ground floor level, which are of mid-to-late eighteenth-century appearance.  The diaper-work brick detailing to the inner faces of the walled garden to the southeast, and to the support wall of the exterior flight of cut stone steps, is an interesting and unusual survival, and suggests that the walled garden is an early feature, probably dating to the early eighteenth century.  Sensitively restored, this building would be one of the more important elements of the architectural heritage of Country, and indeed of Ireland.  The simple rubble stone boundary walls, the gate piers, the remains of the walled garden, the possible remains of an early formal garden (LF023-122----), and the impressive former approach avenue all contribute substantially to the setting of this interesting composition.  A former deerpark (townland to the northeast) at the end of the long approach avenue may have been originally associated with this estate.  Tennalick House is built on lands occupied by the important O’Farrell family until the early 1650s.  The land was seized during the Cromwellian confiscations in 1652, and was granted to Capt. Henry Sankey in 1654 (see below).  Some or most of the lands were restored to the O'Farrell's following the Act of Settlement (THE DISPOSSESSED LANDOWNERS OF IRELAND, 1664, - Lists given to the Duke of Ormonde to select his nominees for restoration.  The O’Farrells had fought with Ormonde on the Royalist side during the wars) and were still in O’Farrell hands in 1706 (Gillespie and Moran 1991).  The O’Farrells owned a castle (LF023-123002-), the remains of which were probably incorporated into a corn mill a short distance to the southwest of Tennalick House.  A number of carved and punched stones built into a wall to the southeast of the house may are of sixteenth-century appearance and may be fabric from this earlier castle.  The lands (some 1350 acres) of Tennalick were granted to a Capt. Henry Sankey in 1654, and he probably built a house here shortly afterwards.   However, it is not clear if the present building dates to this period, of if it was built shortly afterwards (possibly incorporating fabric of an earlier house to site).  The building (or earlier building here) was known as Sankey Manor during the first decades of the eighteenth century (1718?) and possibly earlier.  It was described by Dowdall in 1682 as ‘on the North Side of the river is Tineleeke, Englished the House of Broad Stone where was formerly an old castle, it is now the estate of Mr. John Sankey, whose father Henry Sankey Esqr. did much to improve and built a large house on it’. John Sankey’s daughter (Bridget?) married George Gore in 1702/3, and it is likely that the house was either rebuilt or extended shortly after this marriage (the notable long straight approach avenue to the north, known as ‘The Long Avenue’, and the possible remains of a formal garden (LF023-122----), are said to date to this period).  George Gore (1675 – 1753) was a very important individual, serving as Attorney General of Ireland in 1715 and subsequently as one of the chief Judges of the Common Pleas (from 1724).  George Gore was later succeeded by his second son, John Gore (died 1784) who also served as Attorney General of Ireland of Ireland, Lord Chief Justice and Speaker of the Irish House of Commons in 1767 (he was arguably the most important person in Ireland during the late 1760s – 1780s).  John Gore was made first Baron Annaly (first creation) in 1766 (his brother Henry Gore (1728 – 1793), M.P. for Longford, was made the First Baron Annaly, second creation, in 1784).  The Gore family had a fine townhouse at No. 50, St. Stephen’s Green, Dublin, which was leased from a Gustavus Hume from 1772.  This building is now amalgamated with No. 51, St. Stephen’s Green and forms part of the headquarters of the Office of Public Works.  It would seem that the Gore family used Tennalick House as an occasional prestige country residence, and spent most of their time residing in Dublin, the heart of political and legal activity.  There is a fine marble memorial monument to the Gore family to the interior of Taghshinny Church of Ireland church (13402329) to the northwest.  The estate was leased to a Nowlan of Dublin from 1793 and it may have been the home of a Valentine Dillon c. 1800.  It later passed into the ownership of Luke White sometime between 1804 – 10 (the White family had a lodge/house at Rathcline during the nineteenth century; and were later Barons Annaly of the third creation from 1863).  White subleased the house and land to John McCann and Sons, millers from Drogheda who owned Tennalick Mills (LF023-123002-) to the south (and possibly Cloghan Mills - 13402351).  The house and lands may have been sold in 1828 when the 'Mansion and Estate of Tennalick, containing 194 acres' were put up for sale for 'lives renewable forever at a pepper corn fine' (Newspaper Advert 1828). The McCann’s reputedly used part of the house as stabling for dray horses (used for pulling barges along the Royal Canal).  The ground floor level of the south wing appears to have been reused as these stables, whilst the first-floor level appears to have been used as a store for animal feed.  Slots at regular intervals in the side walls of this floor were used for depositing feed for the animals in the stables below.  Lewis (1837) described Tennalick House as ‘once the residence of Lord Annaly.. has long been in ruins’, suggesting that the house was unoccupied for a considerable period at this time (probably since 1793, following the death of Henry Gore).  The building was partially in use as a house by the end of the nineteenth century and a Harry McCann lived at Tennalick in 1894 (Slater's Directory).  It was later the home the Kilmurray family until c. 1970s, when it became disused again.",1700,1720,National,house,221710,258914,621656,758935,53.57985143,-7.672978046,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402348_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402348,SURV018

The large piers between the arches, which are of a similar size to the arches themselves, and the general form of this bridge, suggests that it dates to the end of the seventeenth century or the first decades of the eighteenth century.  Dowdall (1682) records no bridge at this point although Piers writing two years later (1684) mentions a bridge at Tennalick, which may be this bridge.  It is indicated as 'Clynan or New Bridge' on an 1838 map of the area (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map), which suggests that it may have replaced an earlier bridge on or close to this site (possibly upstream near the remains of the castle and later a corn mill at Tennalick).  The location of this bridge, which is adjacent to the south of Tennalick House (13402348), hints that this bridge may have some connection with this important early building.  The bridge is robustly-built using rubble stone masonry, and its survival for three hundred years is testament to the quality of its original construction. The triangular-profile cutwaters to the upstream elevation were built to protect the bridge from damage.  The rock-faced masonry to a number of the cutwaters suggests that they were rebuilt c. 1860.  The dry arch to the south end of the bridge indicates that the river was wider at this point when the bridge was originally constructed, and that the channel was later dredged as part of drainage works (probably during the mid-nineteenth century).

The scale of this complex still impresses despite it being roofless and out of use for a considerable period.  These utilitarian structures are robustly built in rubble limestone.  However, the good quality dressed limestone block-and-start surrounds to the openings and the dressed limestone quoins to the corners are of a quality that is not commonly found on industrial buildings.  The contrast between the rubble stone construction and the dressed limestone detailing creates an attractive and interesting textural and tonal appearance to the exterior elevations.  This corn mill complex probably dates to the mid-nineteenth century (not indicated on the Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map of 1838).  It is uncommon to find a large-scale corn mill complex built after c. 1815 in rural Ireland, the majority been built between c. 1780 and c. 1815, which was a boom period for the Irish corn milling industry (partially due to effects the Napoleonic Wars which made trade with continental Europe difficult; large corn mills built after c. 1846 are uncommon in rural Ireland following the repeal of the Corn Laws although a number of large-scale mills were built in sea port locations in the late-nineteenth century ).  This corn mill is one of a number located along the River Inny close to this location, and there is the remains of a medieval castle (LF023-123002-), later converted for use as a corn mill by the McCann family of Drogheda, c. 1800 - 1810, but now ruinous to the northeast of Cloghan Mills and the remains of another corn mill in the townland of Drumanure to the south of Abbeyshrule.  This mill was probably originally built by the Slator family of nearby Clynan House (13402352). It was described as ‘Corn mill, corn kiln and stores’ c. 1860 (Griffiths Valuation – cancelled books), and was in the ownership of an Anne Slator, residing at Clynan House at this time.  It may have been founded by Henry Beven Slator, who also ran a corn mill at Ballymahon to the southwest c. 1850.  This mill is not mentioned in the Valuation Office Mill Book for County Longford, dated 1854, which strongly hints that this complex was constructed after this date.  Cloghan Mills were later in the ownership of a Arthur Slator in 1881, and a Bevan Slator in 1894, described as a miller and corn merchant (both Slater’s Directory).

Spans border with County Westmeath, and located to the southeast of Legan.","This interesting and quite imposing bridge contains spans a long-standing crossing point of the River Inny, and contains the fabric of at least two distinct stages of construction.  The impressive central arch dates to the mid-nineteenth century.  The good quality heavily rock-faced masonry used in the construction of this arch, and the terminating piers to either side, are typical feature of the many bridges built throughout Ireland by the Board of Works in the mid nineteenth-century, and particularly between c. 1847 - 60, suggesting that they may have been responsible for its construction.  The span of this central arch is among the largest in County Longford and is of some technical and engineering merit.  The present bridge replaced and incorporates the fabric of an earlier and much wider bridge located at this site, which was built at a time when the River Inny was considerably wider at this point (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838).  The channel of the River Inny was dredged as part of drainage works (probably during the mid-nineteenth century, and at the same time the central section was rebuilt).  The long rubble stone approach ramps to either side are a feature that this bridge shares with the bridge at Abbeyshrule (13402347) to the southwest.  The small arches with radially-set rubble stone voussoirs with very wide piers between the arches suggest that this bridge is of considerable antiquity, perhaps dating to the late-seventeenth century.  The bridge here was described Nicholas Dowdall, writing in 1682, as a stone bridge at 'Balnacarrow so called from a fishing near the River' (Gillespie and Moran 1991, 209).  Sir Henry Piers, writing in 1684, also mentions the bridge at Agharra (Ballynacarrow).  It is possible that the earlier sections of this bridge are part of the structure described by Dowdall.  The simple forms of these arches are in contrast to the wide span of the later central arch, which provides an interesting historical insight into the development of bridge technology and engineering over a number of centuries.

It is robustly built in good-quality stone masonry, which is testament to the long-term ambitions of the Directors General of Inland Navigation (who took over responsibility for the Royal Canal following the dissolution of the Royal Canal Company in 1813) at the start of the nineteenth century.  It was probably built to designs by John Killaly (1766 – 1832), the engineer responsible for the construction of the Royal Canal between Coolnahay to Cloondara, which started in 1814 and was completed in 1817 (28 years after the canal work was started in Dublin).  The main contractors involved were Henry, Mullins and McMahon.  This bridge is an interesting feature in the rural landscape to the west of Ballymahon and is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.

Recent single-storey extensions to the rear (west).  Now in use as private house.  Pitched and hipped natural slate roofs with rendered chimneystacks with cut stone coping and string course.  Timber bargeboards to projecting gable-fronted bay having fleur-de-lis timber finial to gable apex.  Cast-iron gutters with moulded lion-headed details supported above limestone brackets.  Painted lined-and-ruled rendered walls over chamfered dressed limestone plinth with flush ashlar limestone quoins to corners.  Square-headed window openings with limestone sills and timber casement windows.  Square-headed opening to north face of projecting bay to south end of the front elevation having glazed timber door.  Set back from road in own grounds across the road from associated gateway (13402604) and to the northwest of Castlecor House.  Wrought-iron railings to road-frontage to the east.  Pedestrian gateway to the east comprising a pair of cast-iron gate posts having ball finials and a wrought-iron gate.  Located to the east of Ballymahon.","This small-scale former gate lodge associated with Castlecor House (13402608) retains its early form and character.  It retains much of its early fabric including natural slate roofs and cast-iron rainwater goods, while the loss of some original fabric to the openings fails to detract substantially from its appearance.  It is well-detailed with good quality cut stone quoins to the corners.  The projecting gable-fronted bay with bargeboards and having a canted bay window, lends this building a muted Tudor character, which suggests that it was built during the mid-to-late nineteenth-century.  The unusually ornate cast-iron gutters with lion-headed motifs are a noteworthy feature and an interesting survival, illustrating the attention to detail afforded to even the most mundane of features at the time of construction.  These gutters are supporting along a series of cut limestone brackets, which forms a visually pleasing regularity and an interesting textural contrast of cast-iron against cut stone.  The survival of the early wrought-iron railings to the road-frontage adds considerably to the setting and completes this composition.  This building forms part of an attendant pair of structures along with the associated gateway (13402604) to the east, and part of a wider group of structures associated with the important Castlecor House demesne to the southeast.

Of particular note are the tapered gate piers, which are of very high quality and are testament to the skill of the craftsmen involved in its construction.  These piers have an interesting tapered profile that is almost reminiscent of Egyptian pylons.  The highly ornate cast-iron gates are notable examples of mid-nineteenth century metallurgy, and are amongst the finest examples of their type and date surviving in County Longford.  This gateway is later than the house, and was probably added around 1850 – 60, probably at the same time the attendant gate lodge (13402603) to the west was constructed.

Earlier round-headed doorway with fanlight over survives behind porch.  Set back from road in extensive mature grounds to the southwest of Ballymahon.  Complex of outbuildings arranged around a courtyard to the north.  Main entrance gateway (13402605) to the northeast.","This fine house retains its early form and character.  It also retains much of its early fabric, both to the interior and exterior, despite the recent replacement of some of the window fittings.  It probably originally dates to c. 1770 but was extensively remodelled during the early-nineteenth century and now has a predominately late-Georgian architectural character to the principal block.  This building was probably originally built as a symmetrical building, having a central block with recessed two-storey blocks to either side.  The wide tripartite/Wyatt-window openings and the shallow hipped slate roof are characteristic features of many middle-sized houses built in Ireland c. 1810 – 1820.  The two-storey wing to the southwest corner of the house was built c. 1851 to designs by James Bell (c. 1794 – 1872), a Longford architect who was much patronized by the Edgeworth family in Edgeworthstown, c. 1830, and who was appointed County Surveyor for Longford in 1834.  This house was originally built by the Shuldham family, who developed much of nearby Ballymahon during the early-nineteenth century, and funded the construction of the market house/court house (13316010) in the town c. 1826.  The Shuldham family also lived at Ballymulvey House to the east to Ballymahon, now demolished, from the early-to-mid part of the eighteenth century.  A Pooley Shuldham (who lived at Ballymulvey House, near Ballymahon) of Moigh House died in 1793.  He was married in 1768, and may have built a new house at Moygh/Moigh shortly afterwards.  A John Brady Shoulham (1782 – 1832) of Moigh (and Ballymulvey) served as High Sheriff of Longford in 1823/4, and he was responsible for the extensive remodelling of the house in 1822.  His brother, Molyneux William, served as High Sheriff in 1827 and died at Moigh House in 1846.  A John Shuldham (1826 - 91) of Moigh served as High Sheriff from 1848 - 50, and he probably commissioned the construction of the wing to the southwest in 1851.  He later moved to Dublin to take up residence at a house called Gortmore, later serving as Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of County Dublin.  The Shuldham family seem to have sold or leased out Moigh House from c. 1870?  It was the residence of a William Bond and/or of John Shuldham in 1881 (Slater’s Directory) and was later the residence of the District Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary (Mortimer Geraghty?), based at Ballymahon, from 1892 to 1898.  It was later in the ownership of a Mr. Bryan Mulvihill.

Projecting wing to the west extended by a bay to the west, c. 1850.  Two-storey block added to the northeast corner, between two of the earlier wings, built c. 1850.  Three-bay two-storey block attached to the northeast side of nineteenth-century block, built c. 1913.  Single-storey lean-to extension added to the northwest side of central octagon.  Single-bay two-storey projection attached to the south end of projecting wing to the south side of octagon having box bay window at first floor level and modern conservatory attached to the ground floor.  Modern single-bay two-storey block attached to the northwest side of entrance block.  Building later in use as a convent and then as a nursing home.  Currently out of use (2007).

Complex of single- and two-storey rubble stone outbuildings to the west, main gateway (13402604) and associated gate lodge (13402603) to the northwest.","Castlecor was described by Casey and Rowan (1993, 187) as ‘perhaps the most unusual building of the eighteenth-century anywhere in Ireland’.  It was originally built as a hunting/fishing lodge by the Very Revd. Cutts Harman (1706 – 1784), Dean of Waterford cathedral from 1759 and a younger son of the important Harman family of nearby Newcastle House (13402709).  The original structure now forms the rear of the house as stands today.  It was originally built as a symmetrical two-storey block on octagonal-plan with short (single-room) projecting wings to four sides (in cross pattern on alternating sides), and with tall round-headed window openings between to the remaining four walls.  The single wide room to the octagon at first floor level has an extraordinary central chimneypiece (on square-plan) with marble fireplaces to its four faces; which are framed by Corinthian columns that support richly-detailed marble entablatures over.  The marble fireplaces themselves are delicately detailed with egg-and-dart mouldings and are probably original.  This room must rank as one of the most unusual and interesting rooms built anywhere in Ireland during the eighteenth-century.  The walls of the octagonal room are decorated with Neo-Egyptian artwork, which may have been inspired by illustrations in Owen Jones’ book ‘Decoration’, published in 1856.  The inspiration for this distinctive octagonal block is not known.  Some sources suggest an Italian inspiration, such as the pattern books of the noted architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475 – 1554), or that it was based on the designs of the much larger hunting lodge (Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi) that was built for the Duke of Savoy, near Turin, between 1729 and c. 1731 (The later seems a highly fanciful idea but there are some similarities in plan, albeit on a much larger scale at Stupinigi); while Craig (1977, 15) suggests that the ‘inspiration is clearly the hunting lodge at Clemenswerth in Lower Saxony, Germany’, which was constructed between 1737 – 1747 to designs by Johann Conrad Schlaun for Prince Clemens August, a structure that Castlecor resembles in terms of scale and plan.  However, it may be that the plan of this building was inspired by William Halfpenny (died 1755), an English Palladian architect who created a number of unexecuted designs for Waterford Church of Ireland cathedral and for an associated bishop’s palace from c. 1739.  Interestingly, a number of these unexecuted plans for the bishop’s palace included a central octagonal block with projecting wings, while a number of the church plans included an unusual separate baptismal building attached to the nave, which is also on an octagonal-plan.  The Very Revd. Cutts Harman may well have been aware of Halfpenny’s unexecuted designs, being Dean of the cathedral from 1759 and was probably associated with the diocese from an earlier date, and perhaps he used these as his inspiration for the designs of Castlecor.  The central four-sided chimneypiece is reminiscent of the centerpiece of the Rotunda of Ranelagh Gardens, London, (built to designs by William Jones 1741 – 2; demolished c. 1803) albeit on a much reduced scale at Castlecor.  The plan of Castlecor is also similar to a number of buildings (some not executed) in Scotland, including Hamilton Parish Church (built c. 1733 to designs by William Adam (1698 – 1748) and the designs for a small Neoclassical villa prepared by James Adam (1732 – 92), c. 1765, for Sir Thomas Kennedy.  The exact construction date of Castlecor is not known, however the traditional building date is usual given as c. 1765.  The architectural detailing to the interior of the original block, and perhaps the personal life of Very Revd. Cutts Harman (married in 1751 to a daughter of Lord Annaly of Tennalick 13402348; his duties at Waterford cathedral from 1759; Cutts Harmon leased out a number of plots of land in Longford from c. 1768) would suggest an earlier date of, perhaps, the 1740s.  The architect is also unknown although it is possible that Harman designed the house himself (perhaps inspired by a pattern book or by Halfpenny’s unexecuted designs); while Craig (1977) suggest that the architect may have been Davis Ducart (Daviso de Arcort; died 1780/1), an Italian or French architect and engineer who worked extensively in Ireland (particularly the southern half of the island) during the 1760s and 1770s.  The building was extended c. 1850 (the house appears on its original plan on the Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838) by the construction of a two-storey block to the northeast corner of the house, between two of the wings of the original structure.  The earlier wing to the west may have been extended at this time also.  The lion’s head motifs to the rainwater goods throughout the building (built around and before c. 1850) are very similar to those found at the gate lodge (13402603) serving Castlecor to the northwest, built c. 1855, suggesting that the house was altered at this time, possibly as part of wider program of works at the estate.  The projection to the south wing having the box bay window also looks of mid-to-late nineteenth century date and may also have been added at this time.  The Castlecor estate was bought by the Hussey family during the late-eighteenth century following the death of Cutts Harman, and the first series of works may have been carried out when Capt. Thomas Hussey (1777 – 1866), High Sheriff of Longford from 1840 – 44, was in residence.  However, the Castlecor estate was offered for sale by Commissioners of Incumbered Estates in 1855 when it was bought by a branch of the Bond family and, perhaps, the house was extended just after this date by the new owners.  The Bonds were an important landed family in Longford at the time, and owned a number of estates to the centre of the county, to the north of Castlecor, and a branch also lived at adjacent Moygh/Moigh House (13402606) during the second half of the nineteenth century.  Thomas Bond (1786 – 1869) was probably the first Bond in residence at Castlecor.  A John Bond, later of Castlecor, was High Sheriff of Longford in 1856.  The last Bond owner/resident was probably a Mrs Clerk (nee Bond) who was in residence in 1920.  She married a Charles James Clerk (J.P. and High Sheriff of Longford in 1906) in 1901/2, and he was responsible for the three-bay two-storey block that now forms the main entrance, built c. 1913.  This block was built to designs by A. G. C. Millar, an architect based on Kildare Street, Dublin.  This block is built in a style that is reminiscent of a mid-eighteenth century house, having a central pedimented tripartite doorcase and a rigid symmetry to the front elevation.  The house became a convent (Ladies of Mary) sometime after 1925 until c. 1980, and was later in use as a nursing home until c. 2007.  This building, particularly the original block, is one of the more eccentric and interesting elements of the built heritage of Longford, and forms the centrepiece of a group of related structures.",1730,1770,National,hunting/fishing lodge,213730,257084,613678,757105,53.56367615,-7.793535352,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402608_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402608,SURV018

Associated Church of Ireland church (13316019) located in Ballymahon to the northeast.","This former Church of Ireland rectory is an example of the language of classical architecture stripped to its barest fundamental elements, which creates a fine dwelling in a subtle style.  Its original three-bay two-storey form is typical of Church of Ireland rectory buildings (particularly those built by/using funds from the Board of First Fruits), and many middleclass gentleman’s residences, dating from the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century.  The plain, regular façade is well-proportioned with the decorative focus restricted to the elegantly carved limestone surround to the doorway, which provides a central focus to the main elevation.  This building was extended to the northwest sometime during the mid-nineteenth century. Perhaps c. 1860.  Lewis (1837) records ‘the glebe-house, towards the erection of which the late Board of First Fruits contributed a gift of £400 and a loan of £370, in 1813, is a good residence; and the glebe comprises 34 acres, valued at £45. 9. 85. per annum’.  However, the Irish Parliamentary Returns (1837) state that it was originally constructed at a cost of £721, of which £352 was a loan from the Broad of First Fruits.  It was described c. 1835 as ‘a good house, the residence of Revd. F. McGuire' O'Donovan Letters).  It was the residence of the Revd. Hugh Crawford (moved here in 1844) and Lieutenant-General Crawford, his father, in 1846 (Slater’s Directory).  Lieutenant-General Crawford was a notable figure who commanded the citadel of Antwerp around the time of the Battle of Waterloo (1815).  Revd. Crawford left Shrule to take up residence of Taghshinny Rectory (13402330) in 1855, which was described as a ‘promotion (newspaper article), and was replaced by Revd. Francis Kane.  Shrule rectory was later the home of Revd. James Topham in 1881 (Slater’s Directory), and of a Revd. Purfoy Poe in 1894 (Slater’s Directory) and in 1901 (Census).  The ashlar limestone gate piers to the north are finely carved, reflecting the quality craftsmanship that went into their construction, and they add considerably to the setting.  The simple outbuilding to the rear (northwest) adds to the context of this composition, which is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.

The form of this house, having raised basement with flight of steps to main doorway on the first floor, is of a type that is relatively common in the expanding mid-nineteenth century suburbs of the larger towns and cities in Ireland (particularly Dublin) but is rare in County Longford.  The regular façade is enlivened by the doorway with its elegant spoked fanlight and by the distinctive and unusual timber sash windows.  The rear of the house mirrors the arrangement of the main façade with a tall centrally-placed round-headed window with fanlight.  The elegant flight of cut stone steps serving the main door adds a sense of grandeur and gives this building an strong presence that belies its relatively small size.  The gate lodge to the west is an unusual feature to find at a house of this modest scale and adds considerably to the setting.  The good quality gate piers and the ornate gates are attractive features that add aesthetic interest.  This building, and associated elements, is an interesting feature in the rural landscape to the southwest of Ballymahon, and is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.  The location of this house, adjacent to the northwest of Shrule Mills (13402612) suggests that it may have been originally built by the owner of this impressive industrial complex.  It appears to have been the home of a Nicholas Butler c. 1855, who leased the house from a William Henderson (Griffith’s Valuation).  However, it may have been the home of Philip McGlynn who owned the adjacent mill c. 1855 (Valuations Office Mill Book).  There is a building marked on this site in 1838 (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map) but the form and style of the house to site suggests that it was built or heavily altered sometime later.",1840,1880,Regional,house,213429,255960,613377,755982,53.55358495,-7.798127383,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402611_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402611,SURV018

Single-storey former outbuilding to the northeast.  Ruinous three-storey former corn mill located across the Inny to the west having rubble stone walls and square-headed openings.","This large-scale former corn and flour mill complex is one of the most significant elements of the industrial heritage of County Longford.  Although now derelict with roof collapsing and floors removed, the buildings retain their early form and stark industrial character.  This is one of the few (possibly the only) purpose-built merchant flour mills in County Longford, the majority of other complex were built to mill corn and oats for local use.  Flour mills are usually on a much larger scale due to the need to have vast storage areas for meal, corn and flour.  It probably originally dates to the late-eighteenth or very early-nineteenth century, which was a boom period for the Irish corn/oat milling industry.  However, the complex appears to have been extended c. 1850, when the five-storey block to the south end of the L-plan main structure was built (not depicted on Ordnance Survey first edition map 1838; according to local information there is a date stone dated ‘1847’ to site, not located).  This section may have been built to provide additional storage area.  The round-headed opening to the gable apex of this probable former store may have formerly held a bell.  The four-storey former grain drying kiln to the north, which has a brick vaulted ceiling to the ground floor and the remains of ovens, and the small office/administration building to the southeast, may also have been added c. 1850.  The remains of the former millwheel (16ft in diameter) to the block to the north is an interesting survival that provides an interesting historical insight into past industrial processes and is of technical merit.  The arched openings to the former head and tail races are also of technical merit.  This mill/land was described as the property of Councillor Henderson c. 1835 (O’Donovan Letters).  Lewis (1837) records ‘near the bridge of Shrule, but in the parish of Noughaval, are flour-mills producing annually about 4000 barrels of flour’.  It was later run by Michael Murtagh, leased from Wm Henderson, c. 1855, when the site was described as consisting of ‘house, offices, flour mill and kiln’ and had a ratable value of £80 (Griffith’s Valuation).  It was later in the ownership of a Matthew Fegan in 1881 and 1894 (Slater’s Directories).  It closed down in the early 1900s.  The three-storey former corn mill on the opposite bank of the Rover Inny was in the ownership of a Philip McGlynn c. 1855, when it had two 11ft wheels powering two sets of stones (Valuation Office Mill Book).  It is interesting that there were two large mills in such close proximity, which indicates that this was a location along the Inny that had the capacity to produce a significant amount of water power.  The five-storey mill has interesting historical associations with the noted poet and nationalist John Keegan Casey ‘Leo’ (1846 – 1870), one of the central figures in the Fenian Rising of 1867, who worked as a clerk at the mill sometime during the 1860s.

Although never a great financial success, the Royal Canal was carrying 40,000 passengers and 80,000 tonnes of freight annually c. 1830.  This figure declined to c. 30,000 tonnes annually during the late-nineteenth century due to competition from the more efficient railway network (The Midland and Great Western Railway Company bought the Royal Canal c. 1845).  The canal and this store was still in use until 1961, when the canal was closed to commercial traffic.  The location of this building, which is sited at the closest point at which the Royal Canal passes the town of Ballymahon, suggests that it may also have been in use as a canal ticket office and waiting rooms for canal passenger traffic.

The house may have been sold in 1859/1860 (references to insolvency case in the Landed Estate Courts involving Murray family of Clooncallow).  Clooncallow was later the residence of a John Shaw Esq., J. P., in 1881 (Slater’s Directory).

The good quality wrought-iron gates are among the best surviving examples of early ironmongery in Longford and add considerably to this appealing composition.  This gateway is arguably too grand for a house such as Clooncallow (13402716), which suggests that it was originally built to serve another house and that it was moved to its present location at a later date.  The style of the gate piers suggests that they date from the mid-eighteenth century, which also suggests that they originally served a different house.  The form and carved detailing to the piers is very similar to that found at a now disused gateway (13402718) serving Creevaghmore House (13402719), which is located a short distance to the south of Clooncallow, hinting that these piers may have originally served an entrance to this fine estate.  They are also similar in form to the secondary gateway (13402713) serving Newcastle House to the northeast.  The pineapple finials surmounting the piers are well-carved and are an unusual feature.  It was apparently a seventeenth and eighteenth-century tradition for soldiers/sailors/gentlemen etc. to place/impale fresh pineapples to the gates of their house on returning from trips to exotic locations overseas.  This tradition later developed into a fashion for cut stone pineapple motifs being used as architectural details on buildings, gateways etc. (the pineapple has been interpreted as a symbol of hospitality and high status).  The simple single-storey gate lodge to the north adds to the setting and completes this interesting and appealing composition.",1750,1790,Regional,gates/railings/walls,217512,256147,617459,756170,53.55515307,-7.736513087,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402717_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402717,SURV018

The form and carved detailing to the piers is very similar to that found at a Clooncallow House (13402717), and it is possible that the gates at Clooncallow House formerly served another entrance to Creevaghmore House (possibly originally to the northeast of this gateway).  Although now no longer in active use, this gateway forms an appropriately grand entrance to a building of the importance of Creevaghmore, and is an important element of the built heritage of the local area in its own right.  The simple rubble stone boundary walls to either side add considerably to the historic setting and context.  A gate lodge formerly stood to the south side of the gateway, inside the estate, but is now demolished (Ordnance Survey six-inch maps 1838 and 1914).  It is probable that the original main entrance to the estate was a short distance to the northeast of this site where the boundary wall steps in (Ordnance Survey maps), and that this gateway was built later.  A straight approach avenue from this probable former gateway would approach the front of the main house, a characteristic feature of gateways found at early eighteenth-century estates in Ireland.",1750,1790,Regional,gates/railings/walls,217083,255686,617031,755709,53.55102447,-7.742999759,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402718_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402718,SURV018
13402719,Creevaghmore House,,,,,CREEVAGHMORE,Longford,LF,LF,"Detached seven-bay two-storey country house with attic storey, built c. 1750, having pediment over central three-bays to front elevation (northwest).  Built on U-shaped plan having two-storey returns either end of the rear elevation (southeast).  Single-storey extension and additions to the rear (southeast) of rear returns having pitched or lean-to natural slate roof; single-storey outbuilding blocks attached to the southwest end of building having brick bellcote over with round-headed opening; two-bay single-storey extension with lean-to natural slate roof to rear, between rear returns.  Pitched natural slate roof to main block having rendered chimneystacks to gable ends (southwest and northeast) having terracotta pots, and with cast-iron rainwater goods.  Rendered chimneystacks to gable ends of rear returns.  Moulded limestone eaves course to pedimented central three bays.  Roughcast rendered walls.  Square-headed window openings having cut limestone sills and nine-over-six timber sliding sash windows with partially exposed sash boxes, six-over-four box timber sliding sash windows to outer bays to central three-bay section with pediment over.  Oval window to pediment with decorative timber glazing bars.  Mainly replacement window openings to rear; tripartite timber sliding sash window to the rear return to the northeast at ground floor level.  Square-headed door opening to centre of front elevation (northwest) having carved limestone Gibbsian surround with architrave and prominent keystone; and with timber panelled door.  Cut stone threshold and moulded limestone step with cast-iron bootscraper to entrance.  Timber panelled window shutters, timber wall panelling and a decorative timber staircase to interior hallway.  Set back from road in extensive mature grounds to the southeast of Ballymahon.  Gateway (13402718) and rubble stone boundary wall to road-frontage to the east.  Complex of outbuildings (13402720) arranged around a courtyard to the rear (east/southeast).  Rubble stone boundary wall to the rear of house having wrought-iron pedestrian gate.  High rubble stone boundary wall to south end of rear elevation (southeast), probably originally part of walled garden complex.","This very fine and well-proportioned early-eighteenth century house/country house retains its early form, character and a great deal of its early fabric.  The central pedimented section with an oval window opening having delicate decorative timber glazing bars, the treatment of the window openings to the central three bays, and the fine doorcase with Gibbsian surround provides a central focus and gives this building a strong classical character, albeit in a vaguely vernacular manner, and articulates a graceful symmetry to the front façade.  The prominent and heavily detailed Gibbsian doorcase, which is of an unusual design, adds a strong element of artistic interest to the front elevation.  The long narrow window openings have timber sash windows with partially exposed sash boxes, which are indicative of an early date.  Craig (1976) draws a comparison between the plan of Creevaghmore House and Plate IX of John Payne's ‘Twelve Designs for Country Houses’ (dated 1753, published 1757).  The U-plan with lean-to section connecting the wings to rear, along with the placement of the staircase in the hallway and primary utility rooms facing the farmyard, is remarkably similar.  Since Creevaghmore probably pre-dates the publication of this design book, Craig surmises that this layout was a popular contemporary farmhouse plan widely used in the early-eighteenth century.  The survival of such an intact example of an early eighteenth-century farmhouse/house/small country house is extremely rare, making this an important example of its type.  It forms the centrepiece of an important group of related structures along with the entrance gateway (13402718) and boundary wall to the west, and the complex of outbuildings (13402720) arranged around a courtyard to the rear (southeast), and is among the most important elements of the built heritage of County Longford.  This building has historical connections with the Sandys family, who lived at Creevaghmore from the mid-seventeenth century (a Simon Sandys of Creevaghmore is detailed in the 1659 census of Ireland and a Freke Sandys received a grant of land in Longford in 1663) probably until c. 1854 (see below).  Freke Sandys of Creevaghmore was appointed a Commissioner for County Longford by King William III in 1699.  The presence of the Sandys family at Creevaghmore from c. 1655 suggests that the present building replaced an earlier house on or close to this site.  It is possible that Creevaghmore dates to the late-seventeenth century, and the proportions of the window openings are quite similar to those found at Springhill, County Derry , which was built c. 1680 (Springhill does not have the pediment).  A William Sandys of Creevaghmore (died 1774) served as High Sheriff of Longford in 1758.  Creevaghmore was the home of a Robert Sandys Esq., (1782 – 1847) in c. 1835 (O’Donovan; Letters; Lewis) and in 1846 (Slater’s Directory).  It was the home of a Edwin Moore Sandys J. P., son of Robert, c. 1850.  The house and lands may have been sold by the Incumbered Estates Court in 1854 (newspaper article in Longford Journal).  A Charles Webb Esq., J.

They probably originally date to the middle of the eighteenth century but the brick surrounds to the openings suggests that they were extensively altered during the nineteenth century.  These outbuildings survive in good condition and retain their early form and character.  The scale of these structures provides an interesting historical insight into the extensive resources required to run and maintain a middle-sized country estate in Ireland during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Of particular note is the survival of the cast-iron grills and cast-iron horse head motif/finials to the stables, which are interesting and unusual features that add an element of decorative interest and indicate the attention afforded to even the most mundane of features on country estates at the time of the construction.  These cast-iron features are probably later additions, perhaps added during the middle of the nineteenth century.  This complex of outbuilding forms part of an interesting group of related sites at Creevaghmore along with main house (13402719) and the gateway (13402718) to the northwest, which together form an attractive grouping in the rural landscape to the southwest of Ballymahon.

Roughly coursed rubble stone boundary wall to road front to the south; hedges, walls and iron railings to other boundaries.  Pedestrian gateway located towards the west end of boundary wall comprising a pair of dressed ashlar limestone gate piers (on square-plan) having cut stone caps and a wrought-iron gate.","This appealing Church of Ireland church is one of the most attractive examples of its type in County Longford.  It survives in good condition and retains its early form, character and fabric.  This notable building has fine cut and carved limestone detailing throughout, (particularly to the entrance front, tower and to the side vestibules) that is of very high quality and helps to elevate this building above many of its contemporaries in County Longford.  The layout of this church is typical of the standard hall and tower church, which were built in large numbers, particularly between 1808 - 1830, using loans and grants from the Board of First Fruits (1722 - 1833).  These small, simple, but well-built churches have become almost iconographic features of the rural Irish countryside.  The side vestibules are a more unusual feature that gives this building a distinctive appearance.  Interestingly, these side vestibules are a feature that is found at a number of the Church of Ireland churches in County Longford, including St. Patrick’s (13312032) in Ardagh and St. Anne's (13401922) at Kilglass, but is uncommon elsewhere.  The impressive bell tower and unusual vestibules were added in 1813 at the expense of the Countess of Rosse in honour of her late husband Laurence Parsons-Harman (1749 - 1807).  Laurence Parsons-Harman was M.P. for Longford 1776 – 1792; created Baron Oxmantown in 1792; created Viscount Oxmantown in 1795; and created Earl of Rosse in 1806.  Lewis (1837) records: ‘the church is a plain building, enlarged in 1810, by a donation from the Countess Dowager of Rosse and to the repairs of which the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have recently granted £316’.  The Countess Dowager of Rosse (of Newcastle House) funded or part funded a number of Church of Ireland churches built or altered in County Longford during the early decades of the nineteenth century, including St. John's Church of Ireland Church at Ballinalee (13304009), St. George's Church of Ireland Church at Keenagh (13313025), and Taghshinny Church of Ireland Church (13402329).  The interior also survives in good condition and retains a good quality carved timber pulpit, a fine timber gallery to the west end and an interesting open timber roof structure.  The encaustic tiles to the floor are dated ‘1870’, and add further decorative interest to the interior.  This church also has a number of high quality stained glass windows.  A window to the south side of the nave commemorates the celebrated playwright Oliver Goldsmith (dated 1897), who was born a short distance to the north of this church at Pallas in 1728; while a window in the chancel, entitled ‘Christ as Good Shepard’, is a memorial to Laurence King-Harman of Newcastle House who died in 1878.  Both these windows were done by Watson and Company of Youghal in County Cork.  The graveyard contains an interesting collection of cut stone grave markers of mainly eighteenth and nineteenth-century date, some of which are of artistic merit.  The earliest grave marker here is dated 1755 (Richard Bryantan of Ballymahon), which suggests that the present church occupies the site of an earlier church building or may incorporate fabric from an earlier church (as Lewis would suggest: see above).  Indeed, a church is located at this location on the Taylor and Skinner map of the area, dated 1777 – 1783.  Goldsmith’s father, the Revd. Charles Goldsmith, was rector of Forgney from 1718 to 1730, but this was probably at an earlier church in the area (possibly to the south of this site at an old churchyard).  The graveyard also contains a burial plot of the important King-Harman family of Newcastle House (13402709), the main entrance (13402723) to same is located adjacent to the east of this church.  The good-quality gate piers to the entrance of the churchyard, and the rubble stone boundary walls, add considerably to the setting and complete this notable composition, which is an important element of the built heritage of the local area.",1750,1820,Regional,church/chapel,219553,255394,619499,755416,53.54831224,-7.705766389,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402721_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402721,SURV018

This simple building has a number of interesting features, including the recessed round-headed arches to the northeast that helps lend this elevation a subdued formal architectural character.  The clustered diagonally-set chimneystacks are vaguely Tudor in style and create an interesting silhouette.  This building and the deer park were originally built to serve Newcastle House (13402709) to the northeast, the seat of the Harman family from c. 1700 and the King-Harman family from c. 1850.  It was probably originally laid out by Laurence Parsons-Harman (1749 - 1807) who inherited the estate in 1784 and greatly increased the extent of the Newcastle estate to approximately 31,000 acres by his death in 1807. However, there is a record of a Robert Choppyne of Newcastle House leasing the lands of Keel in 1693 so it is possible that this deer park has its origins at the end of the seventeenth century.  It was described c. 1835 as ‘it is a large park, well covered with trees… it is the property of the Countess Dowager of Rosse… ’ (O’Donovan Letters) and was listed as ‘herds, house outbuildings and land’, c. 1860 (Griffith’s Valuation). Its vast scale and largely wooded appearance on early maps (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838) suggests that it was used as a hunting reserve by the Harman and later the King-Harman family (and for entertaining local gentry, guests etc.) and its size would have been a considerable status symbol for the owners of Newcastle House.  The deer park would also have provided venison for use on the Newcastle estate and, perhaps, to provide income for the estate from the sale of meat etc.  This building forms part of a pair of related structures along with the deer park itself (13402728), and part of a wider group of structures associated with Newcastle House.",1780,1820,Regional,gate lodge,216411,254986,616358,755008,53.5447522,-7.753186438,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402724_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402724,SURV018
13402726,Church of the Immaculate Conception,,,,,FORGNEY,Longford,LF,LF,"Detached Roman Catholic church on cruciform-plan, built c. 1830, remodelled c. 1970, having two-bay nave elevations (single-bay to south), single-bay transepts to the north and south and projecting chancel to the east (built c. 1909).  Single-bay gable-fronted entrance porch attached to the nave gable (west), single-storey lean-to sacristy attached to the southwest side of chancel having single-bay flat-roofed addition to the south.  Pitched slate roofs with clay ridge cresting, raised cut stone coping to gable ends having moulded limestone kneeler stones to eaves and carved limestone Celtic cross finials over gable apexes.  Some remaining sections of cast-iron rainwater goods.  Cut limestone eaves courses to nave, chancel and transepts.  Pebbledashed walls over smooth rendered plinth course.  Pointed arch window openings to nave and to gable ends of transepts having stone sills and replacement timber casement windows with timber intersecting tracery.  Three graded pointed arch window openings to chancel gable having figurative stained glass windows.  Three pointed arch window openings to nave gable (west) having simple stained glass windows.  Square-headed door openings to north face of porch and to west elevations of transepts having with double leaf timber battened doors.  Interesting interior with timber panelled gallery to west end of nave, supported on cast-iron posts and reached by carved timber staircase, carved Gothic Revival style timber confessional, wainscoted timber ceiling and marble altar, pulpit and reredos.  Interior reordered c. 1970.  Free-standing single-bay two-storey belfry to southeast corner of churchyard having pitched slate roof with wrought-iron cross finials and decorative timber bargeboards, smooth rendered walls and pointed arch openings at belfry level.  Set back from road in own grounds to the southeast of Ballymahon with gravel forecourt to road-frontage to north.  Rendered boundary walls to site, open to road-frontage to the north.  Modern graveyard to the southeast having rendered boundary walls, wrought-iron gates and grave markers dating from c. 1917.","Despite some modern alterations and the reordering of the interior, this simple Roman Catholic church retains much of its early form and character.  It was originally built as a typical early nineteenth-century T-plan chapel (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838), examples of which were built in great numbers throughout the Irish countryside in the years before and immediately after Catholic Emancipation (1829).  Its simple unadorned form is indicative of the relative lack of resources available to the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland at the time of construction.  The absence of a belfry may also be the result of the restrictions of the Penal Laws, prior to Emancipation in 1829, when the Roman Catholic Church was not permitted to have a bell for worship.  The pointed arch openings lend it the bare minimum of a Gothic Revival character.  This church was extensively altered c. 1909, and the chancel to the east was added at this time.  These works were carried out by the architect Lucius O'Callaghan (1877 – 1954), a son of James Joseph O’Callaghan (noted church architect) and the building work was obtained by James Coote of Longford Town.  The carved limestone Celtic cross finials and the limestone coping, eaves course, and kneeler stones were probably added at this time, and this detailing adds a subdued artistic element to this otherwise plain exterior elevations.  The marble altar and altar goods (c. 1909) were executed by the firm Patrick Tomlin and Sons, a Dublin based firm of sculptors; while the attractive figurative stained glass windows to the chancel gable (also 1909) are by Earley and Company of Camden Street, Dublin, a prolific firm of sculptors and stained glass artists who carried out numerous commissions for the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland during the first decades of the twentieth century.  The timber gallery, which has a finely carved parapet, and the well-crafted and detailed freestanding confessional box add further interest to the interior.  This church is prominently located on the Ballymahon to Mullingar road and together with its bell tower forms a pleasant grouping of Roman Catholic structures in the landscape.  The simple modern graveyard adds further to the setting.  This graveyard was laid out c. 1917 c. 1917 (date of earliest grave marker) and replaced an earlier graveyard (LF027-036----), which is located to the southwest of the site.",1820,1840,Regional,church/chapel,221012,255094,620959,755117,53.54556338,-7.683768305,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402726_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402726,SURV018

Many pre-independence post boxes were simply painted green and retained their royal insignia but are now becoming an increasingly rare sight and are worthy of retention as historical artifacts.  Although the foundry mark is now illegible, it probably was cast by W. T.

It is surrounded by a tall and imposing rubble stone boundary wall, which survives in a good condition and is a highly conspicuous feature in the rural landscape to the south of Ballymahon.  It was probably originally laid out by Laurence Parsons-Harman (1749 - 1807) who inherited the estate in 1784 and greatly increased the extent of the Newcastle estate to approximately 31,000 acres by his death in 1807.  However, there is a origins at the end of the seventeenth century.

The deer park would also have provided venison for use on the Newcastle estate and, perhaps, to provide income for the estate from the sale of meat etc.  The simple complex of outbuildings to the east side of the park is a later addition, added sometime during the second half of the nineteenth century.  The two-storey outbuilding to the south appears to have had a domestic function to the upper floor, probably for housing or providing temporary accommodation for labourers.  According to local information, the rubble stone capping to the boundary wall was added to the boundary as part of a famine relief scheme when Laurence King-Harman (1816 - 1878) was in ownership.  Laurence King-Harman was by all accounts a benevolent landlord (there are no records of evictions etc.) and during the famine years extra labour was taken on to make improvements on the estate.

Of particular significance is the survival of the thatched roof, which is now becoming very rare in County Longford.  This roof is unusual in that it is hipped to one end and pitched to the other, which probably indicates that this building was extended along its length at some stage.  The position of the chimneystack, which is roughly in line with the main entrance, hints that this building has the lobby-entry plan that is characteristic of the vernacular dwellings of the midlands of Ireland.  This building is aligned at a right-angle to the road alignment, which is another characteristic feature of the Irish vernacular tradition.  The porch is a later addition, probably added during the mid-nineteenth century, but is a feature of surviving vernacular dwellings.  Buildings of this type were once a ubiquitous feature of the rural Irish landscape but are now becoming increasingly rare survivals.  The simple collection of single-storey outbuildings and the wrought-iron gates add to the context and complete the setting of this building, which is an integral element of the vernacular built heritage of the local area.

The dressed limestone plinth course adds further textural and tonal variation to the front elevation.  Although the fittings to the window openings have been changed in recent years, they are in keeping with the architectural character of the house and fail to detract substantially from its visual expression.  The present house appears to have replaced an earlier house or houses to site.  The block attached to the rear of the main block appears to be an earlier dwelling to site, while the now ruinous rubble stone structure (with blocked square- and round-headed openings having brick surrounds) may also be a former dwelling to site.  An 1838 map of the site (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map) would suggest that this building with the blocked openings may have been the main dwelling to site at this time.  The simple outbuildings to site, which predate the present main house and were probably built c. 1800, the walled garden, boundary walls and wrought-iron gates to site add considerably to the setting on context to this building and site.  The gate piers to the north of site are probably of recent construction but the cast-iron gates are attractive examples of late nineteenth century mass-produced ironwork.

It is possible that this building was extended to the south by a bay at some stage and, perhaps, that it was originally a single-storey house with attic storey that was later altered to accommodate a second storey (as is sometimes found).  According to local information, this building was formerly in use as a land agents house, perhaps associated with Newcastle House (13402709) who owned much of the land in the area including Keel Deer Park (13402728) adjacent to the east.  However, the strong vernacular character of this house would make this unlikely as land agent’s houses generally have/had a more formal architectural character.  This building is one of the more attractive and well-preserved vernacular houses in the area and is an integral element of the built heritage of the local area.  This building may have been in the ownership of a John Mills c. 1860 (Griffith's Valuation).",1840,1880,Regional,house,215289,255005,615236,755027,53.54495574,-7.770109185,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402734_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402734,SURV018
13402735,Newcastle House,,,,Newcastle Demesne,NEWCASTLE,Longford,LF,LF,"Detached multiple-bay two-storey outbuilding complex on U-shaped plan associated with Newcastle House (13402709), built c. 1760 and altered c. 1800.  Two-storey range attached to the southwest end of the northwest elevation having canted projection to the southwest elevation, overlooking walled garden (13402708).  Pitched and hipped natural slate roofs, ashlar limestone chimneystacks and some remaining sections of cast-iron rainwater goods.  Cut limestone eaves course to a number of ranges.  Roughcast rendered finish over smooth rendered plinth; render failing/removed in places exposing random rubble stone construction.  Square-headed window openings with  tooled cut limestone sills and with six-over-three pane timber sliding sash windows to first floor openings and two-over-two pane to ground floor openings.  Some replacement window fittings at ground floor level; number of window openings now blocked.  Loop hole/slit windows to southwest elevation of block to southwest at first floor level having red brick surrounds; gabled dormer loading bay to centre of southwest elevation of block to southwest having brick surround and timber battened door.  Segmental-headed carriage arch openings to northwest range (southeast elevation) having modern timber battened and sheet metal doors.  Modern square-headed carriage arch openings to the southeast range.  Square-headed door openings having timber battened doors.  Arranged around a courtyard/yard to the southwest of Newcastle House (13402709), within Newcastle Demesne, and to the east of Ballymahon.","This substantial complex of utilitarian outbuildings forms an important part of the setting and historic context of Newcastle House (13402709).  These buildings retain much of their early form, character and fabric, and survive in good condition despite being out of use for a considerable period of time.  The scale of this complex provides an historical insight into the extensive resources required to run a large country estate in Ireland during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and it would have been used to provide a range of services to the main house and to the wider estate.  The presence of finely cut limestone chimneystacks to a number of the blocks suggests that these structures once had an additional domestic function, perhaps accommodating some of the twenty to fifty outdoor staff listed in the daily domestic accounts for the years 1798 to 1800.  It is unusual that this complex is attached to the side of the main house as it is more common to find such complexes away from the main building or shielded from view to the rear.  The site of Newcastle House, which is located on the south bank of the River Inny, may be reason for the siting of this complex to the side as there is little space to the rear.  It is likely that this complex had its origins in the mid-eighteenth century but it was probably greatly extended and altered by during the late-eighteenth/early-nineteenth century, possibly by Lawrence Parsons-Harman (1749 - 1807), who inherited the Newcastle in 1784 and carried out major improvements to the main house and greatly increased the extent of the estate to some 31,000 acres by the time of his death.  The complex is depicted on its present footprint on an 1838 map of the area (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map) suggest that it has largely extant at this time.  The estate was described in 1900 as ‘a master-piece of smooth and intricate organisation, with walled gardens and glasshouses, its diary, its laundry, its carpenters, masons and handymen of all estate crafts, the home farm, the gamekeepers and retrievers kennels, its saw-mill and paint shop and deer park for the provision of venison.  The place is self supporting to a much greater degree than most country houses in England’.  It is likely that many of the activities listed here were carried out in this complex.  These outbuildings form part of an intensive collection of related structures on the Newcastle House demesne, along with the main house (13402709), the stable block to the east (13402710), the walled garden to the southwest (13402708), gateway (13402723) and gate lodge (13402722) to the south/southeast, and the gateway (13402713) to the south/southwest.",1750,1820,Regional,outbuilding,218462,256919,618409,756940,53.56204903,-7.722127152,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402735_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402735,SURV018
13402736,Clooncallow House,,,,,CLOONCALLOW,Longford,LF,LF,"Detached single-bay three-storey building/structure associated with Clooncallow House (13402716), built c. 1820, having flight of cut limestone steps serving doorway at first floor to northeast elevation.  Hipped or pitched natural slate roof, now collapsing.  Roughcast lime rendered finish over random rubble limestone construction.  Square-headed window openings to northwest elevation with tooled cut limestone sills, fittings now gone.  Window opening at ground floor level now blocked.  Square-headed door openings to ground (southeast) and first floors (northeast) with timber battened doors.  Remains of painted plasterwork at ground floor level to interior.  Located to west of Clooncallow House (13402716) and to the southeast of Ballymahon.","Although now out of use and damaged, this unusual structure survives in relatively good condition and retains much of its early form and character.  It is sited within the grounds of Clooncallow House (13402716) and forms part of a collection of related structures along with the main house, the outbuildings (13402715) to the north, the walled garden to the northwest, and the gateway (13402717) and gate lodge to the south/southwest.  Its original function is difficult to interpret but the remains of decorative plasterwork to the interior at ground floor level suggests that it may have had some domestic function associated with the main house, perhaps as a Summer house.  Its unusual tower-like form hints that it may have been built as a folly, although it would be unusual to find a folly so close to the main house.  Its form is reminiscent of a dovecote (and its location close to the outbuildings) but there is little evidence to either the interior or exterior to suggest this.  It could be a feature that predates the present house, that was later modified to fulfill a new function or to act as a folly.  This enigmatic structure is an interesting addition to the built heritage of the local area, and is an interesting feature in the rural landscape to the southeast of Ballymahon.",1800,1840,Regional,building misc,217614,256283,617561,756305,53.5563693,-7.734966812,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402736_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402736,SURV018
13402737,Cartron House,,,,,CARTRON (SHRULE BY.),Longford,LF,LF,"Detached three-bay single-storey gate lodge serving Cartron House (not in survey), built c. 1860, having projecting gable-fronted porch to the centre of the main elevation (east) and single-storey extension to rear (west) having lean-to roof.  Now disused.  Hipped natural slate roof with central rendered brick chimneystack, and remains of cast-iron rainwater goods.  Pitched natural slate roof to porch having decorative timber bargeboard and timber spear finial.  Roughcast rendered walls over slightly projecting smooth plinth course.  Square-headed window openings with tooled cut limestone sills and remains of one-over-one timber sliding sash windows.  Round-headed door opening to front face of porch (east) with timber battened door and blocked overlight.  Wrought-iron flat bar gates to the south of gate lodge having curvilinear wrought-iron support bars.  Located to the southwest of associated gates (13402733) and to the north of Carton House.  Sited to the south/southwest of Ballymahon.","Although now dilapidated, this simple but well-proportioned gate lodge retains its early form, character and much of its early fabric.  The form of this gate lodge suggests that it dates to the mid-to-late nineteenth century, and it appears to have replaced an earlier gate lodge at the same location (Ordnance Survey first edition six-inch map 1838).  It forms a pair of related structures along with the associated gateway adjacent to the northeast (13402733), and is a modest addition to the built heritage of the local area.  Sensitively restored, this building would make a positive contribution to the rural landscape to the south of Ballymahon.  This building was built to serve Cartron House to the south (not in survey), and is located at the start of a long approach avenue to the house.  Cartron House itself has historical connections with the Wright family from c. 1770 at the latest (a James Wright of Cartron died 1772 – will) until c. 1885.  Lewis (1837) states that this was the home of a J. Wright, Esq. (Grand Juror of Longford in 1843), while the estate of an James S. B. (Simon Bradstreet) Wright of Cartron was some 236 acres in extent c. 1876.  Cartron appears to have passed on a branch of the Slater family c. 1890, and was the home of an Arthur Slater in 1894 (Slater’s Directory).",1840,1880,Regional,gate lodge,215035,255090,614983,755113,53.54573325,-7.77392586,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402737_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402737,SURV018
13402738,,,,,,ABBEYSHRULE,Longford,LF,LF,"Detached three-bay two-storey house/farmhouse, built c. 1860, having single-storey return to the rear (south).  Pitched natural slate roof with raised rendered verges and rendered chimneystacks to gable ends.  Cast-iron rainwater goods.  Roughcast rendered walls over rubble stone construction.  Square-headed window openings with tooled limestone sills and six-over-six pane timber sliding sash windows.  Central square-headed door opening having cut stone plinth blocks to base, timber battened door having cast-iron door furniture and with overlight with vertical glazing bars.  Cut limestone threshold to front of door.  Single-storey return to rear (south) with pitched slate roof, rendered rubble stone walls, and square-headed window openings with six-over-six pane timber sliding sash windows, wrought-iron security bars and tooled limestone sills.  Set back from road in own grounds to the south of Abbeyshrule and to the east of Ballymahon.  Hooped wrought-iron flat bar gates to the east gable end of house.  Single-storey outbuildings arranged around a yard to the rear (south) having pitched natural slate roofs, rubble stone walls, square-headed window and door openings with red brick dressings with timber fittings.  Segmental-headed carriage arches to outbuilding to the south having red brick voussoirs to arches.  Modern farm buildings to the southwest of site.  Long approach avenue to house from avenue to the northwest.","This appealing and quite picturesque small-scale house, of mid nineteenth-century appearance, retains its early form and character.  It also retains much of its early fabric including natural slate roof and timber sliding sash windows.  This building probably originally had a entrance porch, now removed.  The form of this building suggests that it is a vernacular interpretation of the typical three-bay two-storey house with muted classical pretensions, examples of which are a feature of the rural Irish countryside.  This well-maintained building is among the more attractive and best preserved examples of its type in County Longford, and is a worthy addition to the built heritage of the local area.  Buildings of this type were once a common feature of the Irish rural countryside but are now becoming increasingly rare making this an important survival.  The simple single-storey outbuildings and the hooped wrought-iron gates add to this composition and complete the setting.",1840,1880,Regional,house,222594,258397,622541,758418,53.57516952,-7.659661056,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/13402738_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LF&regno=13402738,SURV018
