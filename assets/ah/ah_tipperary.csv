The wide chimneystacks on the gable, the return to the rear, and the relative lack of depth in the plan are all typical of a seventeenth-century building.  The irregular placement of the windows is due to very thick interior walls, which may also indicate an early origin.  The tall elegant proportions of the windows, with their small panes, however, are typical of the neo-Palladianism of the eighteenth century.  It is probable that these windows were enlarged during the 1796 remodelling, when the main entrance is thought to have been elevated from the ground to the first floor, creating a half-basement, which would explain why, unusually, they are taller than the door.  The basement has a possible shot hole, evidence of an early defensive feature, now blocked by the steps.  The cantilevered elliptical timber staircase, now the focal point of the house, also appears to date to this remodelling.

Founded in 1306, the monastery was dissolved in 1540, and fell into a ruinous condition before being substantially rebuilt as a Roman Catholic church in 1823.  The main body of the church dates to the early fourteenth century, with a fifteenth-century chapel to the south of the choir, and a transept of similar date in ruins to the north.  The long narrow nave with no aisles is typical of medieval Augustinian church building.  The church we see today was at one stage only one of four ranges arranged around a cloister, in a typical monastic arrangement.  The east range, originally four storeys high, can be seen and the mill, standing on the site of the refectory, gives some sense of the enclosure which would have been the cloister.  The snecked walls and sculpted entrance of the west façade are indicative of the craftsmanship involved in nineteenth-century stone masonry, as it was erected after the demolition of a medieval tower in 1836.  The large pointed opening to the north of the nave, now filled with stained glass, was formerly the entrance to the old Lady Chapel, which was excluded from the nineteenth-century rebuilding programme, and has some fine sculpted stone corbels at impost level.  The chancel and present Lady Chapel to the south also contain fine sculpted exposed stone.

The monument marks the spot where he is thought to have been shot.  The sculptor Albert Power prepared plaster casts of Irish wolfhounds which were to be cast in bronze. Due to lack of funds these were never cast and the plaster casts were used for the unveiling in 1935. The bronze wolfhounds, erected 1996, are the work of sculptor Pauline O'Connell.
