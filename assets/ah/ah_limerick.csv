Pedestal is decorated with a relief of Saint John's Castle and is surmounted by a conical tower and cross, showing that Limerick was a cathedral city. This symbol is now the civic insignia of the Corporation. The Latin inscription is taken from Virgil's description of Troy. The pedestal was moved to its present location in 1990. Plaque reads: 'This pedestal was erected May 1865 John Rickard Tinsley Mayor'. Plaque on ground reads: 'Treaty Stone moved to this location 1990 Ald. Gus O'Driscoll Mayor of Limerick'.","The Treaty Stone occupies a prominent position at Thomond Bridge, and across the river from Saint John's Castle and is one of Limerick City's most famous monuments. The pedestal was reputedly designed by William Edward Corbett (1824-1904). It was regarded traditionally as the writing table on which The Treaty of Limerick, 3rd October 1691, was signed. This tradition dates back at least to 1797, when John Harden of Cork mentions it in his diary, and Dr. Young, Bishop of Limerick, born in the city in 1746, so described it to Dr. Milner, Vicar Apostolic of London, in 1808. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland between the Jacobites and the supporters of William of Orange. The stone stood outside the Black Bull public house in Thomondgate, where it was used as a step for mounting horses. There it was attacked by souvenir hunters, and to prevent this, a subscription was begun in 1863, which resulted in its erection onto a pedestal opposite its former position, in 1865. The Treaty Stone bears little resemblance to its former shape, in fact it is little more than half its original size. The stone was moved once again in the 1980s, the proximity to the corner of Thomond Bridge and the busy traffic from High Road, raising fears that the stone and pedestal may have caused the road to collapse and cave in.",1860,1870,National,monument,157559,157750,557519,657794,52.66964648,-8.628081627,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/21507007_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LI&regno=21507007,SURV021

The previous medieval bridge was of fourteen arches. It is believed to incorporate pier foundations from the bridge which it replaced, as survey drawings dated to 1814, demonstrating the re-use of existing historic fabric by James Pain. The proposal for the replacement was made to the Corporation in 1816 but the bridge was not built until between 1836-40. William Henshaw Owen was the resident engineer for the bridge works. The bridge forms an arresting and commanding presence on the River Shannon, not least because of the straightforward yet accomplished design by the Pain brothers, but also because of its proximity to the ensemble of structures, which include: the thirteenth-century Norman castle of King John; the toll house, also by the Pain brothers, and the Church of Ireland Church of Saint Munchin's, whose tower and spire are visible from the bridge.

The portico reaches over the public pavement in the same manner as does the porticoes of the Bank of Ireland, College Green and GPO, O'Connell Street. In this case, it was most likely designed in this manner to emphasise its presence on this relatively narrow streetscape. Internally it was inspired by the basilica church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. The architects Jones and Kelly completed Corbett's unfinished church between 1928-31; the contractor was Michael Gough, of Wolfe Tone Street, Limerick. The decoration was carried out by Hookinson. The church was consecrated in December 1931. The Franciscans have been present in Ireland for approximately seven hundred years and in Limerick the site of the ancient monastery, with no known above ground remains, is located around Sir Harry's Mall. Thomas de Burgo established this first monastery, and the probable date is c. 1245. The monastery became known as Saint Francis Abbey, the name it retained during the Suppression. The Abbey River derives its name from the proximity to the monastery. The friars were expelled from the city for a short time in 1651, after which they successfully regained occupation of their residence at the junction of Athlunkard Street and Nicholas Street. A site in Newgate Lane was acquired in 1782, on which a chapel and friary was built. The present site on Henry Street was acquired in 1824, and a church was built in 1826 and a friary in 1827.",1870,1890,Regional,church/chapel,157496,157135,557456,657178,52.66411244,-8.628937034,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/21512005_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LI&regno=21512005,SURV021

Built to the designs of the great Scottish engineer Alexander Nimmo (1783-1832) between 1823-35, it was completed by John Grantham in 1835. The foundation stone was laid on the 25th October 1824 and the bridge was opened 5th August 1835, with a cost of £89,061. The design of the bridge is based on Pont Neuilly in Paris. Each span reaches 70 feet, with each arch rising to a height of 8 feet 6 inches. The contractor was Clements and Son. The existing metal swivel bridge, manufactured by Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Co. of Darlington, replaces an earlier nineteenth-century twin-leafed swivel bridge manufactured by Forrester & Co. Liverpool. This fine bridge contributes to an outstanding view which includes the Shannon Rowing Club, and in the distance the Court House, Saint Mary's Cathedral and King John's Castle.

One of the original stone plaques was overlain by a bronze plaque which recorded in Irish the names and event of the 1916 Rising. Another plaque reads: 'This memorial was erected by means of voluntary public subscriptions in memory of the Limerick men and their comrades who died for --- during the Easter Rising of 1916'.

Saint Munchins College opened here in 1853, under the patronage of Bishop Ryan. The College, known as Saint Munchin's Diocesan Seminary. A Diocesan College was an educational institution in which both laymen and future priests pursue their secondary studies together. A wide range of subjects was on offer, including Music, Drawing, Painting, and Dancing. A major change in the running of Saint Munchin's took place when Bishop Ryan decided to remove the diocesan clergy from the college. Bishop Ryan approached the Society of Jesus with a request to take over the administration of the College. After formal negotiations were successfully concluded between the Bishop and the Society of Jesus, both in Ireland and in Rome, Saint Munchin's College became a Jesuit-run school on 10th March, 1859. By 1862 the Diocesan College moved to Crescent House. The coach house in Hartstonge Street is quite modified but forms part of an intact row of coach houses to the rear of the terrace.

Access was not possible to the interior, however, fine barrel vaults were detected at first floor level.","Given its origins this structure is certainly among one of the most unique within Limerick City. It was conceived by the banker William Roche (d. 27th April 1850) as a vast store, which was surmounted by enclosed gardens referred to as Roche's Hanging Gardens. They were built to the rear of his residence at 99 George's Street - now O'Connell Street. According to an article by Jim Kemmy: 'the plan involved the building of stores under a series of arches ranging from 25 to 40 feet high. On top of these arches elevated terraced or ""hanging gardens"" were created and the whole structure was crowned by classical statues.' It is estimated that the work cost £15,000 to complete. Quite sophisticated heating and irrigation systems were employed to maintain the vegetation, such as, exotic fruits like oranges, grapes and pineapples. Only two bays of the store and substantial parts of the original vaulting which supports the terraces is still intact",1800,1820,Regional,building misc,157384,156860,557344,656904,52.66163441,-8.630554056,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/21517041_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LI&regno=21517041,SURV021

In 1938 Patrick Joseph Sheahan was responsible for the painting and decoration with the architectural firm Sheahan & Clery.

O'Connell is nearer to the people than those on top of columns, such as the Rice Memorial. O'Connell wears contemporary clothes under the toga and the text of the Act of Catholic Emancipation is prominent in his left hand. The Irish figure is elevated to classical hero. The monument is a bid for power and influence by the newly empowered Catholic nationalist element in the city. It was designed for the Limerick Committee for the O'Connell Testimonial in 1856 and unveiled on the 15th August 1857. The total cost was £1,300.

Lead flashing to cornice to the pediment with a stone cross to apex and an elaborate mosaic of c. 1926, to the tympanum, depicting Saint Joseph carrying the Child Jesus.

Corbett, was consecrated in April 1904 as a chapel of ease for Saint Michael's parish. The builders were J.J. Ryan & Son. It continued in this role until 1973 when the new autonomous parish of Saint Joseph was created. Saint Joseph's is a very late example of a classical church and it has an exaggerated pediment. The front elevation mosaic, along with the architecture, reinforces the Italianate style and impression of the church. It retains all internal and external features including some fine stained glass windows, in particular a late Harry Clarke Studio window on the south elevation of the nave.

21517177,Saint Michael's Church of Ireland Church,,Pery Square,,Limerick,LIMERICK MUNICIPAL BOROUGH,Limerick,LI,LC,"Detached Church of Ireland church, designed in c. 1836 and completed in 1844, in a late Georgian Gothic Revival design, comprising a single-cell church standing on a crypt. Distinguished by a north-facing limestone ashlar façade comprising a three-stage tower with crenellated parapet with corner and intermediate pinnacles. The tower is structurally and visually strengthened by angle corner buttresses. Raised, and pinnacles added in 1877. It breaks forward from the façade which has a crenellated parapet and angled corner buttresses which terminate with pinnacles. Lancet windows flank the tower which accommodates the principal entrance at its ground floor stage. Smooth limestone ashlar faced side six-bay single-storey side elevations over coursed and squared limestone crypt elevations. Each bay is articulated by engaged buttressing and terminated with a crenellated parapet which returns from the façade. Each bay has a pointed-arched window opening with carved drip stone and elaborate tracery in the Perpendicular Gothic style to the northern three bays and forming cusped arched tracery to the southernmost bays. Chancel to south elevation. Pointed-arched window opening to second stage of tower with perpendicular tracery to upper sections of multiple-paned timber sash windows. Pointed-arched door opening with carved drip stone with label stops; canted, stepped and profiled reveals join at apex; flight of limestone steps gives access to tongued and grooved timber double doors with panelled tympanum above. Tudor-arched opening to side elevation distinguished by a squared label moulding with recessed panelled spandrels, smooth ashlar chamfered reveals, and double-leaf tongued and grooved timber doors; arrived at by limestone flag bridging basement area. Intact church interior with altar and arched chancel to south end and enclosed narthex to north end with gallery above. Interior remodelled, in 1877, with the addition of the chancel. Plain plastered walls with all emphasis apparently given to unusual hammerbeam roof structure with arch braces encased by tongued and grooved panelling. Highly decorative lateral timber tie-beams. Polished marble columns with foliate capitals support limestone arch which defines the chancel which is illuminated by a perpendicular Gothic tracery window with stained glass panes. Encaustic tile floor covering to nave aisle flanked by early box pews. Richly carved mahogany pulpit with Gothicised panelling. Figurative stained glass window glazing replaces original Georgian panes, which survive to the three northern bays to east and west. Multiple commemorative and memorial plaques to the interior. Front site enclosed from Pery Square by fine boundary treatment comprising limestone plinth wall supporting wrought- and cast-iron railings, terminating with emphatic limestone piers with stop-chamfered corners o a battered base and having a pyramidal capping stones surmounted by the cast-iron bases of gas lamp standards. Vehicular access to west with sloping lane to rear site.","This church was designed by James Pain with George Richard Pain. It was built in a simpler form than the original design and without the spire. In 1877, Joseph Fogerty & Son carried out improvements to the church, which included the addition of an extra stage to the tower, a new forecourt and new chancel which incorporated the east window designed by James Pain which was removed from Saint Mary's Church of Ireland Cathedral and reduced in size. The chancel was added at a cost of £2,000 by William and Robert Fogerty. The church re-opened on the 18th November 1877. The stained glass, which illustrates the Parables, were erected in 1878. Further work was carried out by in 1883 with the design of the mural monument in memory of Mrs. Purdon Wilkinson. The work was carried out by Charles W. Harrison, Dublin to the design of Joseph Fogerty & Son. The stone cut piers and the tiled entrance floor of the church were given as gifts by Robert Hunt J.P. This church stands at the southern end of Pery Square facing Saint Saviour's Dominican Church. The original Neo-Georgian façade Pery Square gives balance to the urban composition of the two similarly scaled and styled churches terminating the vista of the street to the north and the south.

The architectural firm of Swann and Wright, the architect Charles Francis Annesley Voysey were competition entrants in 1903. The assessor of the competition was George Coppinger Ashlin. The contractor was James P. Pile, Lower Erne Street, Dublin and the cost of the library was covered by the gift of £7,000 from Andrew Carnegie. The foundation stone of the library was laid by Andrew Carnegie on the 20th October 1903. The architects Giron and O'Callaghan were responsible for an extension in 1944-45 while N. Mathews, BE, in 1946, installed the electric lighting. George P. Sheridan was among a number of architects who were responsible for the design of Carnegie libraries throughout the country, which included: Rudolph Maxmilian Butler, Batchelor and Hicks, and Richard Caulfield Orpen. Sheridan is also responsible for a number of Carnegie Libraries in Co. Waterford including one in Ballyduff (1910), another in Cappoquinn (1911), and finally Lismore Carnegie Library (1910). Andrew Carnegie was a nineteenth-century industrialist born in Dunfermline in Scotland and his fortune was amassed investing in iron and steel industries in America.

Spring Rice (1791-1866) was still alive, in his late thirties, an MP for the city, with a government post, and a landowner in County Limerick. He was extremely popular in the city. He was later 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon, County Kerry. His initial election as MP in 1820 had involved the triumph of the Independent party, which represented the merchant interest and it broke a well established, conservative oligarchy that had dominated Limerick politics for many years. His supporters were involved in the building of Newtown Pery and it was fitting that his monument should have a prominent place in the new town. The statue was erected in 1829 by the Barrington family, who invested heavily in this part of the city and who anticipated further expansion, which was never realised.

To east faces directly onto Griffith's Row. Detached priory to north on adjacent site, c. 1940-50.","This Gothic Revival Church, though much altered from the earlier Gothic designs of the James Pain, has a strong presence in the area. It was begun for Prior Fr. Joseph Harrigan and consectated 6th July 1816. The repairs and alteration in 1860 were carried out by J.J. McCarthy. The contractor for that work was John Ryan. The architectural composition and carved limestone detailing, which is a composite of Pain's original design and later alterations, most notably that of William Wallace in the 1860s, is testimony to the skill of the architects involved and the craftsmanship of the artisans involved in its construction. Wallace heightened the exterior and interior by 20 feet with the addition of a clerestory and rose window in the 1860s. George Goldie designed a new chancel, high altar, reredos, tabernacle and east window between 1863-66. The sculptor for the altar was Bolton of Worchester; the sculptor of the reredos was Patrick Scannell of Cork Marble Works. The stained glass was by William Wailes of Newcastle. In 1870 Goldie and Child remodelled the interior and exterior and the work was supervised by Maurice Alphonsus Hennessy, CE, Limerick. The builders were McCarthy and Guerin. In 1896 and 1899 the stalls and the railings to the Sacred Heart Chapel were designed by George Coppinger Ashlin. In 1927 the communion rails and gates were designed by Ashlin and Coleman. The church terminates the view from Pery Square to the east, while the south elevation facing onto Dominick Street dominates the view from the east. At any point on Baker's Place the contribution of this limestone church to the streetscape is further enhanced by the Tait Memorial Clock and the former priory, now the Mid-Western Health Board Offices on Pery Street. Saint Michael's Church of Ireland Church, which terminates the view of Pery Street to the west, adds to the prominence of these ecclesiastical buildings within the Georgian district of Pery Square.",1815,1960,Regional,church/chapel,157615,156714,557574,656758,52.66034449,-8.627130864,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/21518014_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LI&regno=21518014,SURV021

Limerick working on Adare Manor, where he designed the principal garden elevation. The foundation stone was laid on the 1st May 1856 and it was open for worship following consecration in 1859, although unfinished in July 1861. During his formative years under A.W.N. Pugin, who incidentally designed some interior spaces at Adare Manor, Hardwick developed the grammar of Gothic Revival architecture, which is so well realised in the design and execution of Limerick's Roman Catholic Cathedral. One of his sketch designs for the tower was adapted and carried out by M.A. Hennessy. The spire, which rises to 280 feet, was built between 1879-83, to the designs of the local firm of Mssrs. M.A. and S. Hennessy. M.A. Hennessy added 105 feet to Hardwick's design. T. Byrne was the clerk of works and the original builder was Patrick Kenna, Glentworh Street. He was replaced by Thomas Byrne in 1879. The tower was being built from within when it in September 1882, almost complete it was damaged by a storm. It was thus completed in September 1883. The interior was renovated which included the reordering of the sanctuary in 1893-94 for Bishop Edward Thomas O'Dwyer. The design and plans were inspired by Saint Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham. The work was carried out by Walter Doolin and Messrs Ryan, Limerick. The Cathedral was consecrated by Cardinal Logue on the 21st June 1894. Saint John's is composed of locally sourced limestone which is used to face the building and for the Gothic Revival architectural detailing. The cathedral is dominated by its spire, a more beautiful and seminal element in the skyline of the city could scarcely be imagined. Internally, much of the original floor tiles, pews, memorials and confessionals survive to enhance the otherwise solemn architecture of the nave, aisles and transept.

Square columns to each side of the entrance, blank frieze, no use of triglyphs, with large prominent dentils. Fronts onto Mulgrave Street.","This imposing prison complex was designed for the Grand Juries by James Pain. Pain won the competition in 1816 and the prison was opened in 1821. It was built in conformity with contemporary thinking in Britain on penal reform, penal architecture and social purpose of prisons. It was intended that each prisoner be housed in separate cells, i.e., that the various different categories of offenders were housed separately. This was in contrast with older prisons where all prisoners were placed together. There were two prison plans - radial and polygonal. Both were highly geometrical and symmetrical in architectural style. The radiating plan was chosen for Limerick and it was the most modern prison in Ireland at the time. The unadorned Doric entrance front adds a suitably austere atmosphere necessary for such nineteenth-century civic buildings.

The central block was formerly the Governor's Quarters and consists of a single-bay two-storey entrance breakfront with clock tower above, flanked by a single-bay and a two-sided right-angled projection which joins a further four-bay two-storey over basement wing set at an angle to either side. The four-bay wings form part of the composition of the central block and attached is a fifteen-bay two-storey over raised basement wing having a lower roof level and lesser detailing. These wings are terminated by a four-bay two-storey over raised basement block which is angled to the same orientation as the central section, forming a pair of slender elevations with the perpendicular single-storey outer wings. This pattern is repeated to the rear with each space between the radiating wings, formerly known as the 'Airing Yards', being occupied by a variety of mostly single-storey stone buildings. Hipped natural slate roofs throughout with several limestone ashlar and rendered chimneystacks with terracotta pots and cast-iron rainwater goods.

The entire central section is defined by a copper coated parapet wall with ornate cornice below, while also being distinguished by its squared, coursed, snecked and tooled limestone ashlar walls on a plinth course below. The carved limestone central door surround consists of a replacement double-leaf timber-panelled door with a carved architrave surround flanked by a pair of pilasters and scrolled console brackets supporting a heavy segmental arched cornice containing a spoked fanlight (possibly original). Door opens onto a limestone platform and four steps flanked by a low wall with coping to either side. Square-headed window openings with flush voussoired lintel stones,limestone sills and uPVC windows.

Most other wings have uPVC windows with some of the single-storey wings having camber-arched window openings with brick reveals and twelve-over-twelve timber sash windows.","An extensive and symmetrical complex of stone buildings displaying a wealth of quality building skills and expressing the architectural styles and the moral enlightenment of the time. Designed by Francis Johnston and his nephew William Murray following the passing of legislation in 1817 which required the provision of public aylums for the insane. The contractors were Gilbert Cockburn and Arthur Williams. The foundation stone was laid in May 1824 and the asylum was opened on the 30th January 1827. The cost was £30,200. Further additons were made, before 1835, by Francis Johnston. The architects came up with two designs, a large and a small version, of which only Limerick and Ballinsloe were built according to the larger design. The footprint is roughly a H-plan with a superimposed X-plan with a central Governor's House to the very centre. Set in open countryside about a mile outside the City, the idea was to provide a purpose-built structure which reflected and facilitated the reformist belief in curing madness through social conditioning. The central panoptic block allowed the Governor to observe all wings, which were occupied according to sex and type of illness. The patients were to view the Governor's House as the constant observer who expected an effort to conform to acceptable social behaviour, reflected in the more respectable design of the Governor's house itself. While it is debatable whether this system worked or not, it was a radical improvement on the previous methods of dealing with psychiatric illness. Behind the idea of building asylums was a firm belief in the power of architecture and design as a way of having a more civilised and humanitarian approach to the fringes of society. Also important was the outward appearance of these institutions, in that, the middle-classes could feel assured that these people were being controlled and cured, or at least the imposing architecture made it appear that way. Ireland was the first nation to legislate for the provision of facilities for the mentally ill, and as such Saint Joseph's Asylum stands as one of the first large institutions for the insane in the western world.",1820,1830,National,hospital/infirmary,158525,156403,558485,656447,52.65761659,-8.613637998,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/images/survey_specific/fullsize/21519002_1.jpg,http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=LI&regno=21519002,SURV021

Its style and form mark it out on the streetscape, particularly due to the variety of architectural features and roof types.  The building is of obvious architectural design, and the symmetry of the front façade both belies the large scale of the building and gives it a domestic appearance.  It was designed by the English architect, William Clifford Smith who was working in Limerick City.  Smith's design here follows an adaptation of the English architect Charles Voysey's style of eschewing the complexities identified with late Victorian design.  Voysey's houses featured white rough rendered walls with horizontal ribbon windows and huge pitched roofs, and are recognised for their simplicity, originality and total abandonment of historical tradition.  His style and works are considered formative works in the evolution of the Modern Movement in architecture.  Smith built a town hall that was much more conventional, informal and domestic.

The Trinitarian order was founded in France at the beginning of the twelfth century with the purpose of rescuing hostages taken from the Crusades in the Holy Land.  A panel from the stained glass window above the altar shows a monk about to redeem a hostage.  The original monastery housed a range of monastic buildings: an inner cloister, enclosed on four sides by a church, a dining area, dormitories and workshops.  The monastery fell into disrepair in the sixteenth century following the dissolution of the monasteries.  In 1852 Lord Dunraven had the church repaired and expanded to fill the space which once contained the medieval cloister.  The architect Charles Hardwick, who carried out the restoration, added the convent to the north, the chapel and the porch.  The church as it currently stands, presents an imposing and prominent feature on the main route into the town from the east, which is further outlined by the  tall nineteenth-century nave and tower.  The multiple phase construction is a notable feature, which adds much of historical and architectural interest to the site.  The ornamentation in façade is focussed mainly on the openings, where fine stone work and artistic interest are evident in fine stone crafting such as the floral motif stops and elaborate and varied window tracery.

The house is composed of various elements that are loosely tied together.  It has a long and distinguished architectural history, which began in 1832 with the rebuilding, enlarging and subsequent demolition of the earlier eighteenth-century manor house of the Quin family.  The initial plans for the house were supplied by James and George Richard Pain.  Their services, however, were dispensed with in c. 1838 and the then Lord Dunraven continued with the design of the house himself with help from the English architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham.  The initial phase of construction was completed under the control of master mason, James Connolly, together with the second Earl of Dunraven and his wife, Caroline Wyndham, who incorporated their favourite buildings into the design - the Cloister Court at Eton being a significant influence.  A.W.N. Pugin was employed in 1846 to design some of the interior features including the great hall.  The three-storey southern range and the tower with pyramidal roof, completed between 1850 and 1862, by the third Earl of Dunraven were to the designs of P.C. Hardwick.  The various building phases and styles mesh together to form an immensely impressive building.  The highly decorative exterior incorporating fine stone crafting particularly in the oriel and mullioned windows, door surrounds, frieze and parapet.  The interior features of the building are as impressive as the exterior, incorporating seventeenth-century Flemish choir stalls, excellent wood carving and stone crafted fireplaces and door surrounds.

Godwin studied and measured several Irish Gothic castles before producing his plans for Dromore.  He also designed much of the interior including the wall paintings, fireplaces, ceiling decoration, sculpture, tiles, stained and painted glass, brass work and ironwork, as well as furniture, to whom the commission for furniture went to William Watts of Grafton Street.  Henry Stacey Marks commenced the wall paintings, however, work was abandoned due to severe damp.  To combat this Godwin designed a brick lining with a cavity of about two inches from the stonework, in addition the internal walls and vaults, with the exception of the main entrance vault, were also of brick.  Abandoned in 1949, the roof was removed in the 1950s, however the house remains a striking feature in the landscape and is visible for miles due to its prominent elevated position.

Later it became a Jesuit Apostolic school and then a lay secondary school from 1882 until 1974 when it closed as a school for the last time. The college was opened largely due to the influence of Thomas Spring Rice, Lord Mounteagle of Bandon, Chancellor of the Exchequer in England and an Irish landlord. It was built to accommodate seventy to eighty students but never had more than fourteen students and at times as few as four.  In 1877 it was decided to close the college. It was rented by the Bishop of Limerick for his seminarians for the scholastic year of 1880-1881 and was then vacated.  This surviving substantial building retains a strong sense of its original imposing character.  The Ionic portico from the demolished eighteenth-century country house, Tervoe, survives intact on the front of this building.  The regularity of the classical proportions is enhanced by the unadorned ashlar masonry and lined-and-ruled upper floor façades giving the buildings a dignity and presence fitting to its original purpose as an educational institution.  The outbuildings to the rear surrounding the formal courtyard serve as a reminder of the site's original function as an agricultural college.  Mungret College is an essential part of the architectural character of this area, forming a focal point in the manicured landscape.

Lime was used for lime-washing buildings, particularly farm buildings, as it was regarded as a cleansing agent at the time.

The house and courtyard complex are the ancestral home of Lord and Lady Muskerry and occupies the site of an old bawn associated with the sixteenth-century tower house.

Sir Robert Deane married Ann Fitzmaurice in 1780, the sole heiress of Springfield and was a year later awarded the title Baron Muskerry.  This mansion was burnt in 1921 by the IRA who were afraid that the occupying Black and Tans were going to convert the buildings into a garrison.  The current house was rebuilt by 'Bob' Muskerry, the 5th Baron and follows the Gothic Revival style of the nineteenth century, with characteristic pinnacled turrets to the house and main entrance.  The castellated entrance towers with tooled stone forming the main fabric of the turrets and a grand entrance door greatly enliven the façade of the building.
