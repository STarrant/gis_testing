Having origins in a late twelfth-century earthwork castle the site has been continuously occupied ever since with the present edifice surviving from a comprehensive early to mid nineteenth-century redevelopment programme completed to plans devised by William Robertson (1770-1850) retaining an important element dating from the early eighteenth century: an elegantly composed Classical frontispiece built for James Butler (1665-1745) second Duke of Ormonde possibly to designs prepared by William Robinson (d. 1712) or Francis Place (1647-1728) exhibiting high quality stone masonry is positioned almost on line with a similar breakfront in the associated stable complex (12001065/KK-4766-14-65), thereby enhancing the formal quality of the streetscape of The Parade.  Of particular renown is the great hall accommodated in a later range built to the designs of Sir Thomas Newenham Deane (1827-99) and Benjamin Woodward (1816-61): an exposed timber roof construction identifying the technical or engineering importance of the site features a decorative scheme of artistic significance by John Hungerford Pollen (1820-1902) while a chimneypiece carved by Charles William Harrison (c.1835-1903) (also responsible for carved embellishments in the arcaded stairhall) exhibits particularly fine craftsmanship.

A riot of advanced and recessed bays, battlements, crow-stepped gables, and so on are carefully orchestrated to disguise the earlier disparate ranges in a cohesive architectural skin while supplementary fine details further embellish the architectural design value of the composition.

Although originally featuring light relief or incident the overall severe Greek Revival theme was deemed appropriate for the conveyance of the authority of the judicial system while the close proximity to Gowran Castle (12310003/KK-20-10-03) attests to the Viscounts Clifdens' standing on the Grand Jury.

Generally attributed to John B. Keane (d. 1859) the church also recalls the work of William Farrell (d. 1851), particularly the contemporary Christ Church (1833), Belfast.  The various cut-limestone accents orchestrated to embellish the Classical theme exhibit very high quality stone masonry while moulded rendered dressings further enhance the architectural design value of the site.  A well-preserved interior incorporates a range of features of artistic design importance including stained glass panels attributable to the Franz Mayer Studio of Munich (established 1847), carved timber joinery, and delicate plasterwork dressings, all displaying high quality craftsmanship.
